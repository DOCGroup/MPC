  <title>MPC: WB30 Project Type</title>

  <h1 class="Head1">WB30 Project Type documentation</h1>

  <div>
    <h3 class="Head2">Background/Abstract</h3>
    <li class="body">The <em>WB30 Project Type</em> generates project files
      utilizable by Wind River Workbench, version 3.0.  Workbench is built
      on the Eclipse platform and inherits many of its features.  In this
      document, "eclipse" is used at times to describe features common to
      both eclipse itself and workbench.
      The project type generates workbench projects from generic mpc
      files.  These workbench projects can then be imported into a user's
      workspace and built using the workbench "managed flexible build".</li>

    <li class="body">MPC's WB30 Project Type currently supports Linux
      and Windows as both host and target platforms.  It can be extended to
      support other platforms as well.</li>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="Head2">Usage</h3>
    For every <code>project <var>myprojname</var> { }</code> in mpc files, the
    WB30 project type
    generates a corresponding "workbench project" directory of the form
    <samp>wb_<var>myprojname</var></samp>.  The WB30 Project Type
    uses Eclipse's <em>linked resource</em> feature to work around
    Eclipse's usual requirement that source files reside inside the Eclipse
    project directory.  However, the linked resource feature also comes with
    restrictions; see <a href="#fullpath">the note</a> for details.

    <h4>Generic workflow</h4>
    Presuming .mpc files already exist:
    <ol>
      <li>Generate projects using <samp>-type wb30</samp>.</li>
      <li>Import projects into a Workbench workspace.  From within Workbench
        (preferably an otherwise-empty workspace) select
        <strong>File->Import...</strong> and perform the following actions:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Choose <strong>General->Existing Projects Into
              Workspace</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong></li>
          <li>In "Select Root Directory:" text field, enter the full path
            to the MPC workspace.</li>
          <li>Workbench will scan all the subdirectories looking for existing
            projects.</li>
          <li><strong>Be sure that the checkbox next to <em>Copy projects
                into workspace</em> is <em>UN</em>checked.</strong>
            Copying projects into the workspace unnecessarily duplicates
            files, plus we have found that Workbench can get confused with file
            paths sometimes (though sometimes it will work).</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong> to proceed with the import.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>

   <h4>Building A Project</h4>
   To build a project or set of projects, select the project (or
   projects) in the <em>Project</em> pane, then select
   <strong>Project->Build Project</strong>.

<div>
  <h3 class="Head2">Platforms and Buildspecs</h3>
  The default platform for WB30 is called "Native" and corresponds to creating
  a project in Workbench using File -> New -> Native Application Project.
  Although this method doesn't have (in workbench) any direct support for
  building shared libraries, MPC does generate projects that pass the correct
  compiler and linker flags to create shared (dynamic) libraries.  Selecting
  static or shared libraries with WB30 works the same as with any other MPC
  project type.<p/>
  The alternative platform, "VxWorks" can be selected by passing the option
  <code>-value_template platform=VxWorks</code> on the mwc.pl command line.
  Currently the VxWorks support is inherited from the existing
  <code>-type wb26</code> template, so it may need some more work before it is
  production-ready.  Note that the wb26 template supported only DKM projects for
  VxWorks (Downloadable Kernel Modules).<p/>
  Each platform includes a list of supported buildspecs, and a single default
  buildspec.  For the "Native" platform, the list of supported buildspecs is:
  <ul>
    <li>Linux_gnu_native_3.x_4.x</li>
    <li>Windows_gnu_native_3.x_4.x</li>
  </ul>
  Users can select the list of buildspecs by passing the option
  <code>-value_template buildspecs=&lt;specs&gt;</code> on the mwc.pl command
  line, where &lt;specs&gt; is replaced by the buildspec value or values.
  Multiple values are separated by spaces (with the entire specs string
  enclosed in quotes).  Similarly, the default buildspec can be selected with
  <code>-value_template default_buildspec=&lt;spec&gt;</code>.<p/>
  New buildspecs (or even platforms) can be added by either editing the file
  <code>$MPC_ROOT/templates/wb30dll.mpt</code> (if the modification will be
  submitted back to the public MPC repository), or creating a file named
  <code>user_wb30dll.mpt</code> anywhere on the MPC -include search path.
  Within either of these files, create a scope for the platform/buildspec and
  use assignment statements within that scope to set the various template
  variables.  The existing buildspecs serve as the best examples.</p>

    <h3 class="Head2">Notes</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        MPC doesn't directly generate Workbench workspaces, because they depend
        on an unknown binary file format that it can't generate.  Instead of
        generating files that can be loaded as a Workbench workspace, MPC
        generates two files representing the workspace:
        <ol>
          <li>wb30projects.lst</li>
          <li>org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs</li>
        </ol>
        wb30projects.lst contains comment lines (starting with #) followed by
        one line per project, listing the full path to the .project file.<br/>
        org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs also begins with comment lines
        (starting with #) follwed by the contents of one of the files from
        Eclipse's workspace format, specifically:
        <code>.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs</code>
        Unfortunately, this file alone is not enough to actually constitute a
        workspace because Eclipse uses other binary files in this .settings
        directory.
      </li>

      <li><a name="fullpath"></a>WB30 uses Eclipse's <em>linked resource</em>
        feature to work around the usual requirement that
        all source code reside in Workbench project directories.  These
        act similar to symbolic links.  While convenient so that a
        developer is not required to conform to Workbench's directory
        layout, it comes at a price: the target of the link must be
        specified as a full path. The consequence of this restriction is
        that, once the WB30 projects get generated, the source directory can
        not move in the filesystem without re-generating the projects.</li>

      <li><a name="remove_projects"></a>MPC's WB30 Project Generator
        creates directories named <samp>wb_*</samp> for projects.
        To remove all WB30 projects from a
        directory hierarchy, on Linux you can use a command such as:
<pre>
  $ find . -name 'wb_*' -type d | xargs rm -rf
</pre>
      </li>

    </ol>
