  <title>MPC: RpmSpec Type</title>
</head>

<body>
<div>
  <h1 class="Head1">RpmSpec Type documentation</h1>

  <div>
    <h3 class="Head2">Background/Abstract</h3>
    <ul>
    <li class="body">The <em>RpmSpec Type</em> generates
    <samp>.spec</samp> files suitable for use by the <samp><a
    href="http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora_Draft_Documentation/0.1/html/RPM_Guide/ch-rpmbuild.html">rpmbuild</a></samp>
    utility to build and package.  It additionally creates a Bourne
    shell script that automates creation of source tarball and proper
    dependency-order building/packaging of <samp>.spec</samp> files.
    </li>

    <li class="body">The RpmSpec type refines the existing
    <em>aggregated workspace</em> MPC concept, as well as introduces
    the ability to have <samp>specific</samp> clauses inside
    workspace declarations (<samp>.mwc</samp> files).  Consequently,
    workspace files utilizing these new features are not
    backwards-compatible with prior releases of MPC.</li>
    
    <li class="body">Since RPM is primarily Linux-based, RpmSpec only
    officially supports use on Linux-based systems.  It <em>may</em>
    work on platforms for which an RPM port exists, but such success
    would be coincidental and neither intended, tested, nor
    guaranteed.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="Head2">Pre-requisites</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="body">The following software items are required and
    in the execution path (as well as any of their respective dependencies):
      <dl>
        <dt>RPM</dt>
        <dd>Minimum of version 4.7.1 recommended (not tested with
    other versions).</dd>
       <dt>Development toolchain</dt>
        <dd>This can be the standard development toolchain. Packaging
    for other architectures is supported if the toolchain in the path
    is a cross-compiler for that architecture.</dd>
     </dl>
   </ul>
 </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="Head2">Usage</h3>
    The RpmSpec type refines an existing concept in MPC known as
    <em><a
    href="MakeProjectCreator.html#AggregatedWorkspace">aggregate
    workspaces</a></em> to define package scopes.  When
    <code>mwc.pl</code> is run on a top-level workspace with
    <code>-type rpmspec</code>, each aggregated workspace is presumed
    to define the scope of a package that will become an RPM.
    Inter-project dependencies that exist between any projects known to
    the top-level workspace automatically turn into inter-package
    dependencies in RPMs.
    
   <h4>Generic workflow</h4>
    <div align="center">
   <img src="rpmworkflow.png" alt="rpm workflow"/>
      <h6 align="center">Figure: RPM Workflow</h6>
    </div>
    Presuming <code>.mwc</code> files already exist, and that
    inter-project dependencies are complete and well-formed (i.e.,
    contain sufficient <samp>after</samp> statements to insure proper
    build ordering):
   <ol>
     <li>Use the command <samp>mwc.pl -type rpmspec <em>top-level-workspace.mwc</em></samp> to generate
    <code>.spec</code> files and <samp>*_rpm.sh</samp> builder script.</li>

     <li>Run the <code><em>top-level-workspace</em>_rpm.sh</code>
    script to build/package.</li>
  </ol>
 </div>

 <div>
  <h3 class="Head2">Adapting/Writing Projects for Packaging</h3>
   <h4><a name="mwcnotes"></a>Creating Workspaces</h4>
   <p>The RpmSpec type uses <a
    href="MakeProjectCreator.html#AggregatedWorkspace">aggregate
    workspaces</a> to define the scope of a package.  In other words,
   defining a package involves writing a <samp>.mwc</samp> file that
   includes all the projects that should go into that package.
   An additional <samp>.mwc</samp> file must be written for each
   additional package.  Finally, these <em>package</em> workspaces get
   aggregated into a workspace.

   <p>RPM packages require extra information not needed by "normal"
   MPC projects or workspaces.  This information is defined in a
   <samp>specific</samp> clause in the workspace for the
   <samp>rpmspec</samp> type, e.g.,

   <pre class="codeexample">
// top-level workspace
workspace {
  specific (rpmspec) {
    rpm_version = 1.0
    rpm_release = 1
  }
  package1.mwc
  package2.mwc
}
</pre>
   Details on the variables allowed in the <samp>specific</samp>
   clause can be found in the <a href="../templates/rpmspec.txt">
   <samp>$MPC_ROOT/docs/templates/rpmspec.txt</samp></a> file.
   
   <p>If you use workspaces as a part of
   building right now, you may wish to write additional
   workspace files specifically for packaging via RPM.

   <h4><a name="installready"></a>Making Projects
   <em>Install-Ready</em></h4>
   
   MPC-assisted packaging requires some attention from the developer
   in order to yield its full potential.  What this means is that in
   order for a project to avail itself to be packaged, it must take
   care to insure that any collateral (such as files) that it needs to
   end up in the package get installed via MPC's <em>install</em> feature.
   Note that this feature is currently only implemented within the
   <samp>gnuace</samp> project type.

   Typically, this involves inheriting from the <samp>install</samp>
   base project in order to enable auto-generation of installation
   rules in the makefiles.  MPC defaults to making educated guesses as
   to what files should be installed (e.g., for an <samp>exe</samp>
   project, it figures that the executable should be installed), but a
   developer can augment or replace MPC's guesses using
   <samp>Install*_Files</samp> groupings.  See the documentation on
   the <samp>gnuace</samp> installation feature for details.

   <h3 class="Head2">Notes</h3>
  <h4><a name="rpmnotes"></a>Notes on Generated RPMs</h4>
   <ol>
     <li>RPMs are relocatable using the <code>--prefix</code> or
   <code>--relocate</code> options to <code>rpm</code>.</li>
     <li>The RpmSpec type has no control over where the RPM system performs
     it's "work" (building, staging,
   packaging, etc.).  In the
   past, this was often <samp>/usr/src/redhat</samp>, though your
   system may be configured differently.<br/><samp>rpmbuild</samp>
   holds this directory in its <em>_topdir</em> configuration
   variable. To see the value of <em>_topdir</em> on
   your system, execute the following command:<br/>
   <pre class="codeexample">
<b>$ rpmbuild --showrc | grep '_topdir[^}]'</b>
-14: _topdir	%{getenv:HOME}/rpmbuild
</pre>
   </li>

     <li>Binary RPMs land in <samp><em>_topdir</em>/RPMS</samp>.</li>
     <li>Source RPMs land in <samp><em>_topdir</em>/SRPMS</samp>.</li>
   </ol>

   <h4><a name="scriptnotes"></a>Notes on Generated Script</h4>
   <ol>
     <li>The script takes one optional argument
     indicating the architecture for which it should create packages.
     The script makes no attempt to "find" a toolchain for that
     architecture, instead presuming that whatever toolchain is
     needed can be found in the PATH or is specified in the
     <code>.spec</code> file.</li>
     
     <li>The script performs a build/install activity for each package.
   Installation is not into the running system, but rather into a
   "fake" area.  Installation is necessary to satisfy inter-package
   dependency requirements.<br/>The location of the "fake" area
   defaults to <samp>/tmp/mpcrpm</samp> but can be changed by setting the
   <samp>&lt;%rpm_mpc_temp%&gt;</samp> in a workspace
   <samp>specific</samp> clause, typically in the top-level
   workspace.</li>
