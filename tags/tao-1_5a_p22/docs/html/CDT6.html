  <title>MPC: CDT6 Project Type</title>
</head>

<body>
<div>
  <h1 class="Head1">CDT6 Project Type documentation</h1>

  <div>
    <h3 class="Head2">Background/Abstract</h3>
    <li class="body">The <em>CDT6 Project Type</em> generates project files utilizable
    by Eclipse's CDT plugin, version 6.  This is the version
    generally available/compatible with the Eclipse "Galileo" release.
    The project type generates eclipse projects from generic mpc
    files.  These Eclipse/CDT projects can then be imported into a user's
    workspace and built using CDT's internal builder.</li>

    <li class="body">MPC's CDT6 Project Type currently supports Linux
    and Windows as both host and target platforms.</li>
 </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="Head2">Pre-requisites</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="body">The following software items are required and
    in the execution path (as well as any of their respective dependencies):
      <dl>
        <dt>Eclipse Galileo</dt>
        <dd>Standard download from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads</a>.</dd>
        <dt>CDT 6.0</dt>
        <dd>This comes packaged together with Eclipse Galileo in the
    <a
    href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/heliosr">Eclipse
    IDE for C/C++ Development</a>.</dd>
        <dt>Eclipse-compatible toolchain</dt>
        <dd>On linux platforms, this should just be the standard
    installation of the GNU toolchain for that linux distribution.  On
    Windows, Eclipse uses the <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a>
    toolchain, available for download.  Suggested tool set is <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/downloads/mingw/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/MinGW%205.1.6/MinGW-5.1.6.exe/">Automated
    MinGW Installer</a>.</dd>
        <dt>a compatible <tt>make</tt> tool</dt>
        <dd>This does not need to be a full-featured GNU make, but it
    must be in the PATH as an executable named <em>make</em>.  On
    Linux, the standard GNU make suffices.  On Windows, <a
    href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm">the
    <em>make</em> package from GNUWin32</a> is a good choice.</dd>
      </dl>

      <li class="body">The default value of 256Mb for Eclipse's Java
    VM heap size is insufficient for building projects the size of
    ACE/TAO/CIAO. A minimum of 768Mb or more is suggested. This can be
    done on the command line launch of eclipse, or in the
    <code>eclipse.ini</code> file.</li>

    </ul>
 </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="Head2">Usage</h3>
    For every <code>project <var>myprojname</var> { }</code> in mpc files, the CDT6 project type
    generates a corresponding "eclipse project" directory of the form
    <samp>cdt_<var>myprojname</var></samp>.  The CDT6 Project Type
    uses Eclipse's <em>linked resource</em> feature to work around
    Eclipse's usual requirement that source files reside inside the Eclipse project
    directory.  However, the linked resource feature also comes with
    restrictions; see <a href="#fullpath">the note</a> for details.

    <h4>Generic workflow</h4>
    Presuming .mpc files already exist:
    <ol>
     <li>Generate projects using <samp>-type cdt6</samp>.</li>
      <li>Import projects into an Eclipse workspace.</li>
   </ol>

   <h4>Workflow for building ACE/TAO</h4>
   <ol>
     <li>Check out a copy of ACE/TAO.</li>

     <li>Configure ACE/TAO for your target(s) by setting up
   <samp>config.h</samp>.
     </li>

     <li>Set up environment variables (<var>ACE_ROOT</var>,
     <var>TAO_ROOT</var>, etc.), <var>PATH</var>,
     <var>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</var> (or similar), etc.
     </li>

     <li>Verify settings in <samp>global.features</samp> and, if changes
     are necessary, make appropriate changes in
     <samp>default.features</samp>.
     </li>

     <li>Generate projects using <samp>-type cdt6</samp> insuring the
     use of <samp>mwc.pl</samp> from within ACE, e.g.,
     <blockquote><pre>
$ cd $TAO_ROOT
$ mwc.pl -type cdt6 TAO_ACE.mwc
</pre></blockquote>
     <samp>mwc.pl</samp> will churn for awhile.
     </li>

     <li><em>Suggestion:</em> Verify that <strong>Project->Build
     Automatically</strong> is unchecked (has no checkmark to its
     immediate left). If this is left on, then the build will start as
     soon as the import in the next step begins, and it will build everything.</li>

     <li>From within Eclipse (preferably an otherwise-empty workspace) select
     <strong>File->Import...</strong> and perform the following actions:
     <ol type="a">
       <li>Choose <strong>General->Existing Projects Into
     Workspace</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong></li>
       <li>In "Select Root Directory:" text field, enter the full path
     to the directory <em>above</em> ACE, TAO, etc. (you can also use
     the "Browse" feature to select the directory from the GUI). For
     example, if you checked everything out into
     <samp>/home/joedeveloper/acetao</samp> and ACE and TAO are in a
     peer layout under that directory, you would enter
     <samp>/home/joedeveloper/acetao</samp> in the text field.
     </li>
     <li>Eclipse will scan all the subdirectories looking for existing
     projects; this can take a few minutes for something as large as
     TAO or CIAO. <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you have previously run
     MPC to generate CDT projects with one workspace
     (<samp>.mwc</samp> file) and then ran it later with a different
     workspace without removing the projects from the first
     generation, Eclipse will still find those projects for import.
     See <a href="#remove_projects">the note on removing generated
     projects</a> for information on how to do that.</li>

     <li><strong>Be sure that the checkbox next to <em>Copy projects
     into workspace</em> is <em>UN</em>checked.</strong> Copying projects into
     the workspace unnecessarily duplicates files, plus we have found
     that Eclipse can get confused with file paths sometimes (though
     sometimes it will work).</li>

     <li>Feel free to use <em>Working Sets</em> or not. You may also
     choose to import a subset of the discovered projects by
     manipulating them in the list, however, experience suggests that
     the list is ignorant of dependency interactions between projects,
     so you must manage that manually (<em>i.e.</em>, you could import
     a project, but not projects upon which the first depends, and
     that first project would then fail to build).</li>

     <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong> to proceed with the import.</li>
     </ol>
     Eclipse will now start populating the <em>Projects</em> pane with
     projects.  If you didn't uncheck <strong>Build
     Automatically</strong>, then builds will start.  Regardless, the
     C++ indexer will run in the background across the source of all projects.</li>
   </ol>

   <h4>Building A Project</h4>
   To build a project or set of projects, select the project (or
   projects) in the <em>Project</em> pane, then select
   <strong>Project->Build Project</strong>. Eclipse will evaluate
   <em>ALL</em> dependencies automatically, though not necessarily
   quickly.
   <p>
   <em>Hint:</em> a good choice to get all of ACE/TAO built is to
   choose the <em>Naming Service</em> project.

<div>
  <h3 class="Head2">Multiple Platforms</h3>
  Just as a project created within CDT can be set up to support
  multiple platforms, so too can projects generated via MPC. To the
  extent possible, the platforms are represented in generated projects
  in the same way as they are in "native" projects (though there will
  be some differences).

  <h4>Generating Projects with Multiple Platform Support</h4>
  <p>
  Platforms are named in a list called <samp>platforms</samp> in the
  CDT6 template (much like other MPC templates). The list defaults to
  the platform on which <samp>mwc.pl</samp> is run.  To generate for
  another platforms, or for additional platforms, you must provide
  <samp>platforms</samp> with the list of platforms to generate.
  </p>
  <p>
  Generate projects using a similar incantation to the default (from
  above) using <samp>-type cdt6</samp> and <samp>-value_template
  platform="&lt;platform_list&gt;"</samp>, insuring the
     use of <samp>mwc.pl</samp> from within ACE, e.g.,
     <blockquote><pre>
$ cd $TAO_ROOT
$ mwc.pl -type cdt6 -value_template platforms="linux cellppu" TAO_ACE.mwc
</pre></blockquote>
  </p>
  <p>
  Platforms are defined as scopes in <tt>templates/cdt6platforms.mpt</tt>.
  </p>

  <h4>Cross-Compilation</h4>
  <p>
  Cross-compilation is handled the same as a platform; the target is
  the platform.  If you want to generate for cross-compilation, the
  cross-compiler information must be defined in a scope (typically
  named for the target type) in
  <tt>templates/cdt6platforms.mpt</tt>. If a scope does not exist for
  the target, follow <a href="#addplatform">the instructions for adding
  a new platform.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
  In the example given above, <samp>cellppu</samp> is the name of the
  platform for cross-compilation.
  </p>

  <h4>Adding a New Platform<a name="addplatform"></a></h4>
  To add a new platform, particularly one for cross-compilation, it's
  probably easiest to start from an existing scope, e.g.,
  <samp>cellppu</samp>. For cross-compilation where the cross-compiler
  toolchain is GNU Compiler-based, you will need to provide the names
  of the various executables in the toolchain in the values
  <samp>as</samp>, <samp>ar</samp>, <samp>cc</samp>, and
  <samp>cxx</samp>.  And, optionally, <samp>ccld</samp> and/or
  <samp>cxxld</samp> if the linker used for linking C and C++
  executables, respectively, is different from the respective
  compiler. CDT expects these to be in the path.

  <div>
    <h3 class="Head2">Notes</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
      There is no generated workspace. Eclipse's concept of workspace is
      very different from MPC's, and there is no way to generate a
      workspace. Eclipse's workspace concept doesn't permit sharing
      among machines or developers or even checking a workspace into
      version control.
      </li>

      <li>The Eclipse "workspace" and MPC project + source must not be in the
      same directory hierarchy.  For example, if you chose to have
      Eclipse store its workspace in
      <samp>/home/joedeveloper/workspace</samp>, you may not put your
      MPC project+source under that directory.  However, putting the
      MPC project+source under <samp>/home/joedeveloper/acetao</samp>
      or similar, <em>i.e.</em>, as a <em>peer</em> to the workspace
      directory, is fine.
      </li>

      <li><a name="fullpath"></a>CDT6 uses Eclipse's <em>linked
      resource</em> feature to work around the usual requirement that
      all source code reside in Eclipse project directories.  These
      act similar to Unix symbolic links.  While convenient so that a
      developer is not required to conform to Eclipse's directory
      layout, it comes at a price: the target of the link must be
      specified as a full path. The consequence of this restriction is
      that, once the CDT6 projects get generated, the source should
      not move in the filesystem.</li>

      <li><a name="remove_projects"></a>MPC's CDT Project Generator
    creates directories named <samp>cdt_*</samp> for projects, similar
    to how the GNUACE generator generates makefiles of the form
    <samp>GNUmakefile.*</samp>. To remove all CDT projects from a
    directory hierarchy, on Linux you can use a command such as:
<pre>
  $ find . -name 'cdt_*' -print | xargs rm -rf
</pre>
      </li>

      <li>Perfect hash generation using the IDL compiler is not
    currently working because the IDL compiler cannot find the
    <samp>gperf</samp> executable. This may be a <code>PATH</code>
    issue, "installation" issue, or an mpc file dependency issue.  The
    IDL compiler works but does not generate perfect hash lookups.</li>
    </ol>
