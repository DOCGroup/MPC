        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed hard-coded 'resource_files' to a call to get_resource_files,
          which is a new method on ProjectCreator.  get_resource_files
          determines the name of 'resource_files' for the current language
          based on the %language hash (for C# and VB this is 'resx_files').
