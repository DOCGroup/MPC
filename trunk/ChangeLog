Thu Sep  3 19:15:49 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:

          Corrected the documentation for the 'remove_from' template
          function.

        * modules/FeatureParser.pm:

          Sort the feature names as they come out for reproducibility.

        * modules/Options.pm:

          Fixed a bug where an ending /. would not be removed from a
          relative path on Windows.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added missing 'lc' related functions to have a symmetry with 'uc'.

Thu Sep  3 12:57:41 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/default.rel:

          Added a comment about comma separating the columns.

        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:

          Added more info about the 'scope' template function.

        * modules/Options.pm:

          Fixed a bug where the valid languages wouldn't be printed in the
          usage.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added a comment about what we're checking and why after
          successfully parsing the template.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed to pass an array reference to the source listing callback
          instead of passing an array.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          Added slightly better support for multiple platforms.  It's still
          not fully functional though.

Tue Sep  1 12:58:30 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed code that added output files (added via the '>>'
          construct) when accessing output files from the template.  The
          code was redundant and when gendir was something other than '.',
          it would cause duplicate files to be added when the template was
          generating the output file.

Mon Aug 31 16:41:00 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM:

          Updated URLs.

        * modules/BCB2007ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/BCB2007WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/ConfigParser.pm:

          Corrected comments.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Alphabetized the keywords (which makes it easier when updating
          documentation).  Updated comments and added a minor performance
          enhancment.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where 'features' used in a template would get confused
          with template scopes.

        * modules/WB26ProjectCreator.pm:

          If the user overrides the template, still provide a valid project
          file name in the project_file_name() method.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where duplicate mpc files added by aggregated
          workspaces would not be correctly ignored.

          Committing changes from Ciju John.  Removed the hard-coded 4 in
          the library names and switch from using $(QTDEBUG) to $(QT_CFG).

Mon Aug 24 13:10:16 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/USAGE:
        * modules/Options.pm:

          Changed VAR to VAL.

        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:

          Added missing <a name>'s.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added associated names to the list of AM_CONDITIONAL.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where $(...) used in an exclude block would cause ./
          to be prepended to the value.  Also, only remove unmatched $(...)
          variables after attempting with the secondary relative values.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where $PWD used in a 'cmdline' setting within an
          exclude block would not be evaluated correctly.

Wed Aug 19 14:28:52 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a 'static' property that can be used within the 'specifc'
          and 'conditional' clauses.  The 'static' property will only be set
          if the -static option was used on the command line.

Wed Aug 19 13:49:34 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          We should also avoid adding references to 'custom_only' projects.
          These also cause warnings in Visual Studio.

Wed Aug 19 02:11:03 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * create_base.pl:

          Added a description of what the script does to the usage.

        * modules/Driver.pm:

          Use DirectoryManager::onVMS() instead of comparing $^O to 'VMS'.

        * modules/Options.pm:

          Removed a redundant exit() call.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added comments to the get_special_value method.

        * modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * modules/VC7WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added the 'managed' setting to the saved project info structure.

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Used the new 'managed' setting in the saved project info structure
          to avoid adding a reference to a non-managed c++ library.

        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Removed the use of <%language%> in the MPC ADD DEPENDENCIES
          comment.  It was not necessary since we have that information
          available from the saved project info structure.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Removed the redundant setting of the 'info' data member.

        * registry.pl:

          Added vc10 and wix types.

        * vs_postclean.pl:

          Changed spaces in a regular expression to \s*.

Fri Aug 14 18:46:11 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/pcre.mpb:
        * config/pcreposix.mpb:

          Added the ability to specify a version for the pcre libraries.

        * config/udm.mpb:

          Fixed a typo.

        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          Fixed a bug where mixed case template variables used in a foreach
          would not be handled correctly.

        * docs/templates/vc7.txt:

          Documented the DisableSpecificWarnings template variable.

        * rpm/MPC.spec:
        * rpm/buildrpm.sh:

          Made packager dynamic based on who's actually creating the RPM.

Fri Aug 14 12:43:22 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/udm.mpb
          Use DisableSpecificWarnings

        * templates/em3.mpd:
        * templates/nmake.mpd:
        * templates/vc6.mpd:
        * templates/vc7.mpd:

          Support the DisableSpecificWarnings template variable as it is in
          vc8 and higher.  Since support isn't built directly into the
          project format, we use the /wd command line option for each
          warning number supplied.

Fri Aug 14 02:20:11 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * rpm:
        * rpm/MPC.spec:
        * rpm/buildrpm.sh:

          Added the ability to create an RPM file out of the MPC source.

Wed Aug 12 22:29:21 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/BMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/WixWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Cleaned up code.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Reverted one of the performance enhancements from yesterday.  It
          made a faulty assumption that caused issue with the DDS builds.

        * modules/WB26WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a 'requires_make_coexistence' method to always use
          -make_coexistence without having to pass the option on the command
          line.

Wed Aug 12 17:56:20 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/gacutil.mpb:

        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:
          Fixed broken link

Tue Aug 11 16:08:20 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:

          Added an Id tag.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Made minor performance enhancements.

        * modules/WB26WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added code to only put top-level dependencies in the project
          files.  This build tool doesn't handle indirectly duplicated
          project dependencies very well.

Mon Aug 10 21:40:58 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Return immediately from generate_default_target_names() if the
          project has custom_only set to 1.  We need not waste time setting
          the sharedname, staticname or exename.

        * modules/WinVersionTranslator.pm:

          Cleaned up and commented the code.

Mon Aug 10 17:55:53 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/global.features:

          Added disabled features that were missing.

        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          Updated the usage and added automatic language selection for java.

        * docs/README:
        * docs/USAGE:

        * docs/html:
        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.css:
        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:

          Converted the Frame Maker source into HTML and updated to reflect
          the current state of MPC.

        * docs/templates/wix.txt:

          Added incomplete documentation for the WIX template variables.

        * modules/GHSProjectCreator.pm:

          Corrected poorly written code.

        * modules/Options.pm:

          Fixed a bug in the -relative_file portion of the usage output.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added the ability to use the 'temporary' pseudo template variable
          outside of a custom_type context.  It will contain a different
          value than 'temporary' referenced from within the custom_type
          context.

        * modules/WixProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed to use 'exeout' instead of the deprecated 'install'
          project variable name.

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          Removed release_link_options for the SuperSonic SDK, the options
          are not ok

Thu Aug  6 15:11:07 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/WB26ProjectCreator.pm:

          Replaced all language related strings with constants stored in the
          Creator base class.

          Also, fixed a bug where a project that contained source files or
          resource files for a language not supported by the project type
          would be created.  Now, the project will be skipped if the project
          type does not support the language setting.

Wed Aug  5 18:41:55 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * MPC.ico:

          Updated to use the new MPC logo.

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified 'conditional' to use properties like 'specific'.

        * modules/WixProjectCreator.pm:

          Inherit from XMLProjectBase and WinProjectBase.  The output is xml
          and this is a Windows specific project creator.

        * docs/templates/make.net.txt
        * templates/make.net.mpd:
        * templates/make.net.mpt:

          Updated to support icon files and resx files, the trace template
          variable and to set the DESIGN and DEBUG constants in debug mode.

Wed Aug  5 06:21:58 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/vc8.mpd:
          Added release_link_options. This fixes bugzilla 3527, thank to
          Chad Elliot for providing the patch

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          Use release_link_options for the SuperSonic SDK

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          No need to set charset anymore

        * docs/templates/vc8.txt:
          Document new release_link_options

Tue Aug  4 18:11:58 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added a new template function, 'extensions', that can be used to
          get a list of valid extensions based on the component name (e.g,
          source_files, header_files, inline_files, etc.)

        * templates/em3.mpd:
        * templates/vc6.mpd:
        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:
        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:

          Use the 'extensions' function instead of hard-coded strings.

Tue Aug  4 16:29:11 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Default the language to 'cplusplus' if it isn't provided during
          construction.  This ensures that language is always set and we
          don't have to check it to make sure it's defined elsewhere.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified the behavior of dealing with resource files.  The
          behavior specific to C++ was being applied to all languages.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added implementations of various template functions.  Some were
          required for the bmake template change below.

        * modules/WixProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed unused code.

        * modules/WixWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a the case of the WixProjectCreator name.

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/bmakedll.mpt:
        * templates/bmakedllexe.mpt:

          Added the ability to build static projects without providing the
          -static option to MPC.  The static-only projects can still be
          created with the -static option, but it is no longer necessary.

Tue Aug  4 10:31:40 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/unicode.mpb:
          Changed this to a feature

Mon Aug  3 16:43:18 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Driver.pm:
        * mpc.pl:
        * mwc.pl:

          Added a pair of constants that will be used in determining which
          type of creators to use (either workspace or project).

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed the use of a hard-coded string and simplified some code.

Fri Jul 24 09:29:31 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/nddslib.mpb:
          Added requires += ndds. If you want to use RTI DDS you have to
          add ndds=1 to your default.features file. This way we can add
          dds4ccm support to CIAO without requiring all users to install
          RTI DDS

Fri Jul  3 03:25:31 UTC 2009  James H. Hill  <hillj@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Added support for setting the install location of a set of
          files for a project using 'install_location'. This takes a
          comma separated list of directories that represent the location
          for installing the files. The following is a simple example:

            specific (wix) {
              install_location = etc models
            }

          The example above will install files for the given project
          in etc/models directory under the root install directory.

Thu Jul  2 06:37:36 UTC 2009  James H. Hill  <hillj@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Fixed bugs GME section of generated Wix files for vc8.

Sun Jun 28 08:05:20 UTC 2009  James H. Hill  <hillj@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Added support for installing GME components using Wix. In order
          to include GME components in the installer, you must define the
          following properties in a *wix* scope:

            gme_install     = [0 | 1]; default is 0
            gme_register    = [HKLM | HKCU]; default is HKLM
            gme_progid      = <program id>
            gme_uuid        = <uuid>
            gme_paradigms   = <space separated list>
            gme_has_icon    = [0 | 1]
            gme_description = <descrption of component>
            gme_tooltip     = <tooltip for component>

          The values for each of these properties can be found in
          ComponentConfig.h

Thu Jun 25 06:25:12 UTC 2009  James H. Hill  <hillj@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * modules/WixProjectCreator.pm:
        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Added support to creating a directory if there is no output
          file specified in the project.

          Disabled skipping projects if there are no useful targets
          defined.

          Added markers to the top and bottom of the component. The
          name of the markers are: component_top and component_bottom.

Thu Jun 25 00:39:12 UTC 2009  James H. Hill  <hillj@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * modules/WixWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * templates/wix.mpd:
        * templates/wix.mpt:

          . First version of the Wix module that is used in conjuction
            with the Wix toolset that creates .msi files. This project
            type will generate the include files (.wxi) that can be included
            in a .wxs configuration file.

            Right now, the installer only can generate files for
            shared libraries. The next update will include support for
            executables.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed hard-coded 'resource_files' to a call to get_resource_tag,
          which is a new method on ProjectCreator.  get_resource_tag
          determines the name of 'resource_files' for the current language
          based on the %language hash (for C# and VB this is 'resx_files').
