          Fuzz fix.

Tue Apr  5 18:47:09 UTC 2011  Don Hudson  <hudsond@ociweb.com>

       * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

         Added default_verbose_ordering() that returns false
         and used it to set verbose_ordering.  This allows derived workspace
         creators to override the default verbose ordering.

         Fixed typo in comment.

         Corrected Perl warning by replacing == with eq in an if statement.

         Modified the verbose ordering warning message to include the name
         of the project being processed.

       * modules/Driver.pm:

          Changed to set verbose ordering on the creator only if it's defined
          in the config file.

        * modules/RpmSpecWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added default_verbose_ordering() that returns true so that
          a warning is logged if there are missing dependencies when
          generating an rpm spec file.

        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:

          Added bracketed (multiline) assigments to documentation,
          i.e., assignment of form:

          keyword <operator> [optional flags] {
                    This is
                    a multiline assignment.
          }

          Optional flags are \s to retain leading white space and
          \n to retain new lines.  These flags are be combined.

        * docs/templates/rpmspec.txt:

          Added rpm_pre_cmd keyword for %pre section of the RPM spec file
          and rpm_url for the URL tag in the RPM spec file.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed to default to cacheok of false as some intermediate project
          files are deleted must be regenerated if a project is regenerated.
          This was causing an error, but the error was only being logged.

          Changed to return an error code and message when workspace generation
          fails in some cases where an error message was only logged.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Added parse_assignment() that pre-parses bracketed assigments
          (see comment on docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html) before
          calling SUPER::parse_assignment(). This method takes an optional
          file handle that must be used for bracketed assignment support.

        * modules/DirectoryManager.pm:

          Corrected typo in comment.

        * modules/Parser.pm:

          Added strip_comments(), strip_lt_whitespace(), and is_blank_line().

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added file handle parse_assignment and related method calls for
          bracketed assignment support.  See comment on modules/Creator.pm.

          Added case sensitivity logic to already_added() similar to other places in code.

        * modules/RpmSpecWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed write_and_compare_file() to return 1 instead of undef as method
          must now return status.

          Added %pre section and URL tag to RPM spec file generation.

        * modules/StringProcessor.pm:

          Changed parse_assignment() to not strip ending new line
          as later parsing may need it.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added file handle parse_assignment and related method calls for
          bracketed assignment support.  See comment on modules/Creator.pm.

          Changed to return an error code and message when workspace generation
          fails in some cases where an error message was only logged.

          Added default_cacheok() which returns true and is used to set 'cacheok'
          so this method can be overridden when 'cacheok' needs to be false.

        * docs/templates/vc8csharp.txt:
        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          Added the "PlatformTarget" template variable for C#.

        * templates/vc10.mpd:
        * docs/templates/vc10.txt:

          Added the "PlatformToolset" template variable.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * docs/README:

          Allow the "*" replacement for assignments to the libs keyword.

Wed Mar  9 13:51:00 UTC 2011  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:

          Added PLATFORM_NDDS_ARGS at the suggestion of Johnny Willemsen.

Thu Mar  3 18:51:23 UTC 2011  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/html/RpmSpec.html:

          Fixed html errors and warnings.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where a project added by an aggregated workspace
          containing a relative path would not be recognized as a duplicate
          if the same project were added by another workspace without a
          relative path.
