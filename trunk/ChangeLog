        * docs/templates/vc10.txt:

          Added the "managed" variable.

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Projects reference were picking up the .filters file for vc10 instead
          of the normal output file (.vcxproj).  For now this is just a
          work-around to remove ".filters" from the relative path to the
          referenced project.

        * templates/vc10.mpd:

          Allow the use of "managed" as a backwards-compatibility synonym for
          "CLRSupport".
          Re-order the nested <%foreach%> loops so that 'platforms' appears
          before 'configurations' (as it does in vc8.mpd).
          DebugInformationFormat is not supported with CLR/managed.
          FixedBaseAddress is not supported with CLR/managed.
          The list of resource files may contain files that are not actually
          passed to the resource compiler (like icons: .ico).  Exclude those
          from <ResourceCompile> but they will still be listed in the project.

        * docs/html/WB26.html:

          Added documentation for -type wb26, this was contributed by
          Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen at remedy dot nl>.

        * templates/wb30dll.mpt:
        * templates/wb30exe.mpt:

          Added dollar-Id-dollar in comments.

Fri Aug  6 00:06:41 UTC 2010  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/CDT6ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where the template name, in project_file_name, would
          default to an invalid name if the template name was not defined.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          Modified to use the C compiler to compile assembler files (instead
          of the C++ compiler).

Thu Aug  5 19:57:19 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          If pchsupport is disabled, don't generate the pch_postrule.
          Also added some Windows native (non-cygwin, non-msys) compatibility
          with -value_template platforms=mingw.

          Merged (reintegrated) the "wb30" branch, which adds -type wb30
          for Wind River Workbench 3.0.  See WB30.html for details.

          This also effectively reverts the commit in
          Fri Jul  9 21:16:23 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>
          because that change was incorrect (-into shouldn't affect the
          file's contents).

          Removed trailing whitespace.

        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:

          Better explained the TemplateParser 'eval' function and documented
          the new TemplateParser 'set' and 'translate_vars' functions.

        * docs/templates/vc10.txt:

          Started the vc10 template variable documentation.

        * modules/CDT6WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Use the WorkspaceCreator::create_command_line_string() function
          instead of printing the "$0 @ARGV" string.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Replaced the use of die with setting the 'error_in_handle' data
          member to bring errors to the users attention and added the 'set'
          template function.

        * templates/vc10.mpd:

          The OpenMP template variable is interchangable with the
          OpenMPSupport template variable.  Older versions of Visual Studio
          used OpenMP.

Wed Aug  4 20:32:14 UTC 2010  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@ociweb.com>

        Merged out changes from the Eclipse CDT branch to support
        side-by-side builds from different platforms and configurations
        and to more fully support cross-platform builds.

        * templates/cdt6cproject.mpd:

          Changed postbuild "installation" scripts so that they put
          libraries into platform-config specific subdirectories in order to
          support multiple builds concurrently.

          Added platform-specific lib directory to library paths.

          Omit generation of build information for platforms when a
          project inherits from crosscompile.mpb.

        * modules/CDT6ProjectCreator.pm: Propagated "nocross" template
          variable into CDT6 projects via fill_value.

        * modules/CDT6WorkspaceCreator.pm: Minor changes.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added new keyword/function "vars_equal", to compare the values
          of two template variables for equality.

          Default GenerateDebugInformation to "true", Release configurations
          will override it to "false".  Use the value of the
          GenerateDebugInformation variable in the template.

Mon Aug  2 15:24:10 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * templates/vc10.mpd:
        * templates/vc10filters.mpd:

          Use <CustomBuild> instead of <CustomBuildStep> for custom actions
          that apply to individual input files (as opposed to the custom
          actions that apply to the project).

Tue Jul 27 15:40:16 UTC 2010  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@ociweb.com>

        * templates/cdt6cproject.mpd: Added missing space between thread
        flags and pic flags.

        * templates/cdt6cproject.mpd:
        * templates/cdt6dll.mpt:
        * templates/cdt6platforms.mpt:

          Initial work for supporting a cross-compile platform. Fix for RT
          14228 related to the lack of -fPIC option.

        * templates/cdt6cproject.mpd, templates/cdt6platforms.mpt:

          Fixed issue where linker exe names could not be overridden.

        * docs/html/CDT6.html:

          Update documentation.

Wed Jul 14 05:00:11 UTC 2010  James H. Hill  <hillj at cs dot iupui dot edu>

        * config/wix.mpb:

          Added a prebuild command to delete the old installer before
          building the new installer.

Tue Jul 13 16:38:44 UTC 2010  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Removed tabs.

        * modules/VC10ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug relating to the get_template() implementation that
          arose when the language is not C++.

Tue Jul 13 14:37:32 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          the project file inside the workspace file.

Tue Jun 29 18:18:56 UTC 2010  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@ociweb.com>

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm: split_parameters() was returning an
        empty parameter.  This should fix errant extra whitespace
        generated in bmake test output.

          The Id attribute for the exename/sharedname was not normalized.

Mon Jun 28 05:42:48 UTC 2010  James H. Hill  <hillj at cs dot iupui dot edu>

        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Bug fix where the generated Id for the File element contained
          invalid characters.

Mon Jun 28 04:46:49 UTC 2010  James H. Hill  <hillj at cs dot iupui dot edu>

        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Bug fix where the File element used the auto-generated Id
          attribute, which resulted in duplicate keys in the installer
          when different project had files with the same name.

Fri Jun 25 21:56:03 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          When parsing the .am file, a line with a : is not an explicit target
          if it's a continuation of the previous line (ending with \).

Wed Jun 23 18:08:17 UTC 2010  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

          name contained a dash.

          Added support for installing GME decorators.

Mon Jun 14 22:06:56 UTC 2010  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Only replace psuedo variables on actual keywords during variable
          modification.  User defined keywords must not have the parameters
          replaced in order for them to get the correct replacement values
          later on.
