          Refactored much repeated code into 3 distinct base modules.  There
          is now a MakeProjectBase, WinProjectBase and VCProjectBase.  Each
          contain methods that are common to Make base projects, Windows
          based projects and Visual C++ project types, respectively.

          Also, the 'win_version' template variable was factored out of the
          ProjectCreator subclasses and into the TemplateParser.

        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Only emit the library or exe setting if source files are provided.
          Thanks to Stephen Torri <storri@cse.wustl.edu> for suggesting
          this.

        * modules/WinVersionTranslator.pm:

          Truncate minor version numbers to 65535 or under as Visual C++ 6.0
          can't handle anything larger.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added code to support the use of nobase_include_HEADERS and
          nobase_pkginclude_HEADERS in the case where 'includedir' isn't
          set.

        * templates/automake.mpd:
        * templates/automakedll.mpt:

          Added support for an 'includedir' template variable that can be
          used to override the default includedir setting determined by
          AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.  In order for header files for a
          particular project to be "installed", the 'install_headers'
          template variable needs to be set to 1.  Thanks to Stephen Torri
          <storri@cse.wustl.edu> for providing this functionality.

        * USAGE:
        * modules/MPC.pm:
        * modules/MWC.pm:

          Removed support for Visual Age 4.  It was incomplete, out-of-date
          and most likely didn't work at all.

          Removed these files.
