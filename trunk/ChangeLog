        * modules/AutomakeProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/MakeProjectBase.pm:
        * modules/Parser.pm:

          Reduce op code count.

        * modules/CommandHelper.pm:

          Added a debug message to assist users in figuring out why their
          helper isn't being picked up.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Modified recursive_directory_list() to skip .svn and CVS
          directories.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a very old and incorrect assumption that output file names
          generated as part of a custom definition had to be longer than the
          length of the input file name.

        * templates/vc8.mpd: Allow a project to be a "make output" type using
          the VCNMakeTool section instead of the usual compile, link, etc.
          sections. This allows one to drive nmake-type projects from a
          VC project. Also, enable setting the DebugInformationFormat even
          when doing an optimize/Release build. Thanks to Kelly Hickel for
          contributing these.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug in my change from Thu Jul  3 11:46:23 UTC 2008.  Files
          were not being automatically added when they didn't exist on the
          file system.

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          MPC had always assumed that output files went into the same
          directory as the input file (unless specified otherwise through
          gendir).  Now, in the Define_Custom for the command, this
          assumption can be modified.  If 'output_follows_input' is set to
          0, it will assume that output files go into the same directory as
          the project (unless specified otherwise through gendir).

Mon Jul  7 13:10:46 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified the behavior of adding to prebuild, postbuild, and
          postclean.  Values that are added are now separated via the
          command separator for the project type.  This will assure that
          multiple commands are executed separately (and unconditionally).

Thu Jul  3 16:36:30 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a new keyword, postclean, which is similar to postbuild
          except that it is executed during the realclean target.

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/html.mpd:
        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Added the use of postclean.

Thu Jul  3 14:49:52 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          For the previous change to generate_default_components(), we only
          need to do this if the list of component tags was not provided to
          the method.

Thu Jul  3 11:46:23 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed an issue where a chain of three or more Custom_Define's
          would not have the right default input/output.

Wed Jul  2 16:35:22 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/CommandHelper.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified the helper to be keyed off of the define custom name
          instead of the define custom command name.

Wed Jul  2 14:04:39 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/CommandHelper.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a command helper that can be dynamically loaded to assist
          the project creator in determining which files will be generated
          by a command.  This is useful when the output of a file can not be
          represented by the usual Define_Custom syntax.

Mon Jun 30 14:55:51 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/StringProcessor.pm:

          Added a simple fgrep function that will find a string in an array
          reference.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where custom defines that generate output that can be
          used as automatic input to other custom defines did not work
          properly.  Now, they are automatically added when possible.

Fri Jun 27 12:59:39 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/ixml.mpb:
        * config/upnp.mpb:

          Added base projects for use with the open source project Linux SDK
          for UPnP Devices.

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Split the functionality of the 'automatic' keyword into to two.
          'automatic_in' now specifies that input files are automatically
          added and 'automatic_out' specifies that generated output files
          are automatically added to the project.  These both default to
          true as 'automatic' did.  'automatic' is still accepted, but
          deprecated.

Wed Jun 25 21:38:16 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:

          Documented the following changes.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/VC7ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WinProjectBase.pm:

          Added the <%cmdsep%> pseudovariable that can be used in prebuild,
          postbuild, and postcommand.  It works like <%and%> and <%or%> but it
          unconditionally runs the right-hand side command.
          For postcommand, added <%input_dirname%> and <%output_dirname%> which
          work like their <%*_basename%> counterparts but return the directory
          portion of the file name.

Thu Jun 19 01:27:55 UTC 2008  James H. Hill  <hillj@isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * config/boost_system.mpb:

          Base project for using the Boost system library.

Tue Jun 17 17:16:07 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/templates/make.txt:

          Document the 'depgen_flags' template variable.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceHelper.pm:

          Removed unnecessary parenthesis around variable declarations.
          This provides a very minor performance increase due to reduced
          perl op codes.

Tue Jun 10 14:45:18 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Enhanced support for MinGW with "-type make".

Fri May 30 15:54:22 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>
