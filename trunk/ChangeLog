        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * docs/README:
          Added support for recursive_libpaths and recursive_includes.
          These can be used like libpaths and includes, but they recursively
          add also all subdirectories to libpaths/includes. Thanks
          to Chad Elliott for assisting with the implementation of these
          features.

Mon Oct 22 12:11:13 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:

          Documented variable scopes.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where any type of error in a base feature project
          would be reported as if the end of the feature project was not
          found.

          Also, fixed a bug where a scoped template variable addition would
          be evaluated multiple times resulting in a repeition of the added
          value.

Thu Oct 11 17:42:54 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          Fixed a problem where too many .resx files were being grouped to a
          "matching" 'Form' source file.

Thu Oct 11 15:34:23 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:

          Document a requirement of a <%foreach%> that uses a function call
          with commas.  In this case a variable name and base count is
          necessary.

        * docs/templates/make.txt:

          Documented missing template variables.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Modified the 'remove_from' template function to work in a foreach
          and to allow better string manipulation.

        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          Use the 'remove_from' function to group .resx files that fully or
          partially match a 'Form' source file.

        * docs/README:
        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          Changed the way generates_source works.  See the README for more
          details.

Thu Sep 13 18:02:23 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * create_base.pl:

          Added a script to create base projects based on MPC library
          projects.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed an informational message to provide more data.

Wed Sep 12 18:55:35 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/qwt.mpb:

          Added a base project for Qwt.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where a perl undefined value warning could occur when
          duplicate project names are encountered.

Wed Sep 12 13:13:52 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/mysql.mpb:

          Added base projects for MySQL and MySQL++.

Fri Sep  7 13:41:43 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where using two different custom types in the same
          project, both with 'commandflags' mapped to a new keyword, would
          cause scoped settings from one project type to be applied to the
          other project type.

Tue Aug 21 15:27:52 UTC 2007  James H. Hill  <hillj@isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * templates/vc8.mpd:
        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:

          Added support for the Windows Mobile 6 platform. This platform
          is targeted specifying the "Windows Mobile 6 Standard SDK (ARMV4I)"
          platform.

Thu Aug 16 12:01:28 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * prj_install.pl:

          Fixed a bug where copying an executable didn't set the execute
          permissions on the new file.  Also, unnecessary intermediate
          directories are no longer made during installation.

Fri Aug 10 18:15:22 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/USAGE:
        * modules/Options.pm:

          Fixed the misspelling of Graphviz.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a couple of issues:

          1) Makefile.am is no longer overwritten if the only difference is
             in a comment.
          2) The existing configure.ac is edited to contain all of the new
             Makefiles.  If configure.ac doesn't exist, it is created and
             the Makefile list is written out to configure.ac.Makefiles.
          3) @NAME@ substitutions now only happen in the top-level
             workspace.

        * modules/ConfigParser.pm:

          Only warn the user once about each undefined environment variable.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Factored the file comparison out into a single method on the
          Creator base class.

Wed Aug  8 15:18:04 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Set the required automake version back to 1.9.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          When subtracting, split the subtracted value into elements so that
          they can be removed in any order.

Wed Aug  8 12:29:46 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a code to handle a special associate key to support
          conditional substitutions in the SUBDIRS setting.

Fri Aug  3 13:49:08 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where adding to a mapped keyword as a scoped template
          variable would wipe out the original setting instead of adding to
          it.

Fri Aug  3 11:53:48 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/global.mpb:
        * config/mpb.mpb:

          Removed the MPB Define_Custom out of global and into it's own base
          project.  Users can have their base projects inherit from mpb if
          they want to use it.

Tue Jul 31 13:57:54 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:

          Fixed a few instances where mpd was mistakenly used in place of mpt.

Mon Jul 30 13:47:13 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/global.mpb:

          Added a define custom to allow users to explicitly list .mpb files
          in their projects.

        * prj_install.pl:

          By default, install all .mpb files.

Mon Jul 30 11:33:43 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Support setting a mapped custom defined keyword as a scoped
          template variable.

Wed Jul 11 14:52:02 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * templates/nmake.mpd:
        * templates/nmakedll.mpt:
        * templates/nmakeexe.mpt:

          Moved the default libraries advapi32.lib and user32.lib out of the
          template and into the template-input files using the variable name
          systemlibs.  This allows -value_template systemlibs+=FOO to work.

Fri Jun 29 18:24:22 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Depgen/Driver.pm:

          Removed assigment of () to %types since it was sometimes
          clobbering the value already there (from the BEGIN block).

        * modules/Depgen/NMakeObjectGenerator.pm:
        * depgen.pl:

          Generate dependencies targeting object files instead of cpp files.
          This matches how it's done for GNU make.

        * modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Provide output regarding which projects are being built.

        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Changed how intermediate and ouptut directories are handled, to
          match the change to make.mpd in:

Wed Jun 27 11:28:50 UTC 2007  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/boost_base.mpb:

          Use a new environment variable, BOOST_ROOT_LIB, to determine the
          location of boost libraries.  If this isn't set, it will be
          expanded to $(BOOST_ROOT)/lib which is the default location.

        * docs/README:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a new workspace feature, associate, that associates a name
          with one or more directories.  It does not add directories to the
          workspace, it only makes an association.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Utilize the associate feature to allow conditional building of
          groups of directories.

        * docs/USAGE:
        * modules/Options.pm:

          Document the fact that the directory parameter for the -into
          option should be a full path.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed duplicate code from the add_explicit_output() method.
