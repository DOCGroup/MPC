          Added information to the logging section about the debug setting.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceHelper.pm:

          Added a method, perform_custom_processing, to WorkspaceHelper to
          allow users to be able to inject data into the workspace.

        * docs/USAGE:

          Fixed a minor typo.

        * modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Prefix the calls to cd with @ so that they are not printed during
          a make.

        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          Deprecated the 'install' keyword.  It has been replaced with
          'exeout' to be consistent with 'dllout' and 'libout'.  The use of
          'install' will still be accepted.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm (expand_variables):

          Corrected a problem where "pre/" and "post/" include slashes
          were being changed to have the wrong type of slash.

Wed Aug  9 01:14:54 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          Corrected a bug where multiple variables used within a <%foreach%>
          would not be recognized correctly.

        * docs/USAGE:

          Clarified the documentation dealing with the MPC configuration
          files.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Print out AM_CONDITIONAL's for all of the features known to the
          FeatureParser.

        * modules/BMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where an assumption is made that projects in different
          directories were assumed to be relative.  When absolute
          directories are used, the Makefile would get confused about how to
          get back to the original directory.

        * modules/Driver.pm:

          Compare directories case-insensitively when running on a system
          that does not support case-sensitive file systems while searching
          for the correct MPC.cfg.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

        * modules/Options.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/StringProcessor.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Factored out and simplified code dealing with parsing assignments.

        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Corrected information about getting a dependency generator for
          nmake.

        * docs/templates:
        * docs/templates/common.txt:
        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          The script can be used to document all template variables found
          within a project template (.mpd file).  Currently, only the
          template variables that are common to most templates are
          documented.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added methods to get keywords for use within the devtools scripts.

        * highlight_template.pl:
        * devtools/highlight_template.pl:

          Moved this file into the devtools directory.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Corrected a bug introduced by my change from Fri Jul 14 17:25:16
          UTC 2006.  The original change was intended to deal with Windows'
          inability to have empty environment variables.  I have changed it
          to have a special case where then environment variable value of ""
          is interpreted as the users intent to have an empty string.

        * docs/LICENSE:
        * docs/README:
        * docs/USAGE:

          Moved these files from the root directory into the newly created
          docs directory.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Added a new template function, keyname_used, that is used in the
          automake template to handle the situation where a custom input
          file is used with more than one custom defined type.  If the
          custom input file caused more than one file to be generated in
          each custom defintion, the stamp file would be duplicated causing
          build errors.

Tue Jul 25 15:36:29 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * MPC version 3.4.0 released.
