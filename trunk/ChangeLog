        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * templates/automake.mpd:
        * templates/automakedll.mpt:

          Added support for an 'includedir' template variable that can be
          used to override the default includedir setting determined by
          AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.  In order for header files for a
          particular project to be "installed", the 'install_headers'
          template variable needs to be set to 1.  Thanks to Stephen Torri
          <storri@cse.wustl.edu> for providing this functionality.

        * USAGE:
        * modules/MPC.pm:
        * modules/MWC.pm:

          Removed support for Visual Age 4.  It was incomplete, out-of-date
          and most likely didn't work at all.

        * modules/VA4ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/VA4WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * templates/va4icc.mpd:
        * templates/va4iccdll.mpt:
        * templates/va4iccdllexe.mpt:
        * templates/va4icclib.mpt:
        * templates/va4icclibexe.mpt:

          Removed these files.

        * templates/vc6dsp.mpd:
        * templates/vc7.mpd:

          Added the ability to generate projects that only contain resource
          files.
