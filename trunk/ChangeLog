        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Before using the project name as a regular expression, we must
          escape all of the regular expression specific characters.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/StringProcessor.pm:

          Moved the crlf and windows_crlf method into StringProcessor and
          finally fixed the problem with cygwin.  Now cygwin perl can be
          used with MPC.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Cache the contents of the template input files to avoid reading
          them multiple times.  Also, search for resource files that differ
          only in case from the project name.

        * modules/FeatureParser.pm:

          Cache the contents of the feature file to avoid reading it
          multiple times.

        * modules/Parser.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Took the file caching code out of TemplateParser and moved it into
          Parser so that more classes can use cached file reads than just
          the TemplateParser.

        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Fixed precompiled header problems where the pch source isn't in
          the current directory.  Also, changed the location of the
          intermediate files to use the project name instead of the project
          file without the extension.

        * templates/em3vcp.mpd:
        * templates/vc6dsp.mpd:

          Refactored much repeated code into 3 distinct base modules.  There
          is now a MakeProjectBase, WinProjectBase and VCProjectBase.  Each
          contain methods that are common to Make base projects, Windows
          based projects and Visual C++ project types, respectively.

          Also, the 'win_version' template variable was factored out of the
          ProjectCreator subclasses and into the TemplateParser.

        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Only emit the library or exe setting if source files are provided.
          Thanks to Stephen Torri <storri@cse.wustl.edu> for suggesting
          this.

        * modules/WinVersionTranslator.pm:

          Truncate minor version numbers to 65535 or under as Visual C++ 6.0
          can't handle anything larger.

Tue Jan  4 07:48:20 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added code to support the use of nobase_include_HEADERS and
          nobase_pkginclude_HEADERS in the case where 'includedir' isn't
          set.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * templates/automake.mpd:
        * templates/automakedll.mpt:

          Added support for an 'includedir' template variable that can be
          used to override the default includedir setting determined by
          AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.  In order for header files for a
          particular project to be "installed", the 'install_headers'
          template variable needs to be set to 1.  Thanks to Stephen Torri
          <storri@cse.wustl.edu> for providing this functionality.

        * USAGE:
        * modules/MPC.pm:
        * modules/MWC.pm:

          Removed support for Visual Age 4.  It was incomplete, out-of-date
          and most likely didn't work at all.

        * modules/VA4ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/VA4WorkspaceCreator.pm:

        * templates/va4iccdllexe.mpt:
        * templates/va4icclib.mpt:
        * templates/va4icclibexe.mpt:

          Removed these files.

          Added the ability to generate projects that only contain resource
          files.

        * MPC version 3.2.0 released.
