        * config/cppunit.mpb:

          Added a comment with a dollar Id.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Sort the features when creating the configure.ac file for
          repeatability.

        * modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Change the workspace extension from .nmak to .mak.  This is only
          used when -make_coexistence is used on the command line.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          When checking to see if a feature is enabled, we will now
          explicitly set the feature in the feature parser for later use
          within the AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.

Fri Dec 15 19:38:00 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/cppunit.mpb:

          Added a base project for cppunit.  Set the CPPUNIT_ROOT
          environment variable before processing.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a few bugs.

          1) If -feature_file was used in a 'cmdline' setting within a .mwc
             file, it was silently ignored.
          2) When setting certain 'cmdline' options within a .mwc file, they
             would persist outside of the scope in which they were set.
          3) If the file specified by -feature_file did not contain a full
             path, it would not be used unless it was in the current
             directory.  The MPC include paths are now searched if it does
             not contain a path.

Thu Dec 14 14:30:58 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM:

          Changed to ask for the Operating System and Shell.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          When expanding variables, warn the user if the value returned from
          adjust_value() is a hash table.  When this happens, it means that
          a template scope name collides with a variable name contained
          within $().

        * templates/make.mpd:

          Added support to perform a post link processing command.

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added a post link processing command to perform the integrate step
          for Green Hills on Integrity.

Wed Dec 13 17:05:29 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/zlib.mpb:

          Modified this base project to use an intermediate template
          variable, zlibname, for Windows based project types.  The default
          remains zlib, but can be overridden on the command line or after
          this base project has been included.  For instance, the dynamic
          version of this library is named zdll and would require that the
          user of such library change the zlibname template variable.

        * modules/Options.pm:

          Provide indication when template variables are set on the command
          line.

          Also, warn users when -value_template is used for a project
          keyword.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified the evaluation of template variables such that values set
          on the command line take precedence over those set in projects.

        * modules/Parser.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Removed deprecated environment variables.  All functionality
          provided by the environment variables was moved into the MPC
          configuration file long ago.

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          Added three new C# specific scoped keywords (dependent_upon,
          generates_source and subtype).  See docs/README for more details.

Mon Dec 11 19:36:13 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/yacc.mpb:

          Fixed the postcommand for the custom rule so that both source and
          header file are created correctly.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where defaults source files for custom definitions may
          result in incorrect file addition if the generated source file is
          not the default extension (.cpp).

        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Added a new source component level setting, no_pch.  When set, it
          specifies that precompiled headers should not be used for the
          source files listed within the scope of it's setting.

        * modules/MWC.pm:
        * modules/Options.pm:
        * mpc.pl:
        * mwc.pl:

          Removed the default project type and simplified the addition of
          new project/workspace creators.  Now, you must specify a type on
          the command line or a default type in the MPC.cfg.

Mon Dec  4 16:02:43 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Driver.pm:

          If no MPC.cfg exists in MPC/config, search the config path from
          the starting point for mwc.pl (e.g., $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl).  This
          precludes the removal of $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl.

        * config/base.cfg:

          Removed this file.  It is no longer necessary to provide the
          search paths for ACE related projects.

Mon Dec  4 15:08:19 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/base.cfg:

          Provide default MPC.cfg search paths for ACE related projects.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where grouped generated files would be duplicated due
          to a problem matching up the generated files when gendir is set to
          '.'.

Thu Nov 30 15:31:55 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed bugs where nested scopes and nested workspace aggregation
          would either not use workspace assignments or not have the right
          workspace assignments.  Thanks to James Hill
          <hillj@isis.vanderbilt.edu> for pointing this out.

          'webapp' project keyword in combination with the vc8 projec type.

Wed Nov 29 18:18:54 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where an aggregated workspace with scopes (other than
          exclude) would not be parsed properly.  Thanks to James Hill
          <hillj@isis.vanderbilt.edu> for bringing this to my attention.

Wed Nov 29 12:52:04 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Moved the compile_flags portion out of the CPPFLAGS_COMMON section
          into the specific _CPPFLAGS settings to allow users to put
          compile_flags settings inside the configuration definitions.

Tue Nov 28 17:37:31 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Added the ability to set 'configurations' (as is done for vc6,
          vc7, etc.) so that different versions of executables and libraries
          can be built from the same Makefile.am.  By default, the
          'configurations' template variable is not set.  Thanks to
          Friedhelm Wolf <Friedhelm.Wolf at homag dot de> for providing the
          automake template modifications.

Mon Nov 27 16:58:31 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Convert all output files from custom commands if the project type
          requires slash conversion.

        * templates/vc7csharp.mpd:
        * templates/vc7vb.mpd:
        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:
        * templates/vc8vb.mpd:

          Made resource files not dependent upon any particular source file.
          Also, re-removed the .aspx support in the vc8 templates.  See the
          modification from Tue Jun 20 12:41:49 UTC 2006.

Wed Nov 22 18:07:56 2006  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt: Corrected macros and libs for Smartphone
          WinCE configurations.

Wed Nov 22 20:40:58 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:
        * templates/vc8vb.mpd:

          Added support for resource files (.resx or .resources) and .aspx
          files for both csharp and vb for the vc8 project type.

Wed Nov 22 19:54:01 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          The adjustment of the website project name wasn't correct.  It
          needed to be the dirname of the project name instead of the
          basename.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Removed the scope keyword, webapp, from the workspace and added a
          new project keyword named webapp.  If webapp is set to 1 in the
          project, it will be considered a Web Application, will not have a
          project file written for it and will be included in the workspace
          all if the project type supports Web Applications.  Currently,
          only the vc8 project type supports them.

        * modules/VC8WebWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a new scope keyword, webapp, to allow users to specify web
          application directories.  Any directory specified within a webapp
          scope will be considered as a web application directory.
          Currently only the vc8 project type supports web application
          directories.

        * modules/ConfigParser.pm:

          Disallow empty names within the base configuration file (i.e.,
          $VAR that evaluates to empty).

Wed Nov 22 10:34:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * modules/BMakeWorkspaceCreator.mpc:
          Give the workspace a .bmak extension when using make_coexistence and
          simplified workspace_file_name()

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/bmakecommon.mpt:
          Removed support for the cbx compiler type which was the preview
          compiler shipped with CBuilderX.

Thu Nov 16 13:34:26 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a new feature, Modify_Custom, that can be used to customize
          an existing Define_Custom.

Thu Nov 16 12:25:18 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/global.features:
        * config/xalanc.mpb:

          Added support for Xalan-C++.  The xalanc feature is off by
          default.

        * modules/ConfigParser.pm:

          Support shell and make style environment variables.

          Added a new template variable, 'keyfile', to support assembly
          signing.

Thu Nov  9 13:25:05 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/GHSWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Removed the -I. from the default project and added
          --one_instantiation_per_object.

Mon Nov  6 19:27:44 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/CCProjectCreator.pm:

          Code Composer checks the timestamp on the project file.  So, we
          need to compare the output to ensure that we don't update a
          project file that doesn't need to be.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where generated headers, inline files or template
          files would not be automatically added in the event that the user
          provided input for those types (i.e., Header_Files, Inline_Files,
          or Template_Files) that corresponds to a directory.  Now,
          specifying the following:

          Header_Files {
            some_dir_name
          }

          works as if the Header_Files section was not supplied, which is
          equivalent to the following:

          Header_Files {
            .
          }

          This pertains to automatic addition of generated files.

Mon Nov  6 15:11:47 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where unrecognized lines in 'specific' sections would
          not be flagged as an error.

        * modules/StringProcessor.pm (parse_assignment):

          Since template variable scopes can have spaces in the names, we
          must allow scopes to have spaces in the names here as well.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Put quotes around the variable name when displaying an invalid
          assignment name.  This allows spacing to be taken into account.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          The implementation for the 'targetoutdir' template variable was
          incorrect.  'targetoutdir' was not taken into account for the
          'libpaths' setting.

          Renamed the prelink template variable to prelinktarget to avoid
          conflicting with prelink used in other templates.

        * docs/templates/vc7csharp.txt:

        * modules/VC8ProjectCreator.pm:
        * templates/vc8vb.mpd:

          Added initial support for Visual Basic with vc8.

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Support the prelink template variable as is done in vc7 and vc8.

        * templates/vc7.mpd:

          Modified the template to use PreprocessorDefinitions for
          midl_defines under the VCMIDLTool section instead of
          AdditionalOptions.

          Changed the way the 'trace' template variable worked to be
          consistent between both vb and csharp with vc7 and vc8.

Thu Oct 19 17:29:08 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/GHSWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Modified to create an integrate file (for Integrity projects) and

          Use the create_command_line_string() method instead of printing
          the command line directly.  This opens the door for disabling this
          functionality.

        * mpc.pl:
        * mwc.pl:

          Removed the unused Config module.

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          For wrsppc, wrspentium, and ghsppc compilers, use $(CPUTYPE)
          instead of hard-coding the processor type.

        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Remove the 'output_subdir' template value from all library and
          executable output paths.

Wed Oct  4 17:08:21 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/GHSWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          For Integrity, a bsp file can not be added to the "Program"
          project, it must be added to the "INTEGRITY Application" project.
          So, for the ghs project type only, add .bsp files as documentation
          in the project and the bsp documentation files will be added as bsp
          files  when the integrate project is created.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Factored out the relative replacement code from the ProjectCreator
          into the Creator.  This required the addition of two template
          methods to get different sets of data for relative replacement to
          maintain the same functionality in the ProjectCreator and similar
          functionality in WorkspaceCreator.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where a previous scope of a foreach would hang around
          even when the scope went away.  This could cause strange results
          when nesting foreach's.

        * templates/vc7vb.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:
        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          If a custom definition has an 'output_option' set, the order of
          listing the input file changes such that it is listed before the
          output_option setting in the build rule.

        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          Fixed bugs where complex foreach's (with functions) would not be
          recognized and default template variable values would be
          lowercased.

        * docs/README:

          Clarified the 'exclude' usage.

        * docs/USAGE:

        * templates/cccommon.mpt:
        * templates/ccexe.mpt:
        * templates/cclib.mpt:

          Added complete support for Code Composer 2.0.  This is an embedded
          application IDE for Windows only.

        * modules/GHSWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * docs/templates/ghs.txt:
        * templates/ghs.mpd:
        * templates/ghscommon.mpt:

          Fixed a couple of issues:

          1) Exceptions were hard-coded to be on for all projects.  It is
             now controlled by the 'exceptions' template variable and is on
             by default.
          2) If the primary target is Integrity, Program projects need an
             intermediate INTEGRITY Application project to perform the
             integration properly.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where getting the default value of a template variable
          was not case-insensitive as it should have been.

Wed Sep 20 16:26:48 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/bison.mpb:
        * config/flex.mpb:
        * config/lex.mpb:
        * config/yacc.mpb:

          Added a 'requires' setting for each base project matching the file
          name (e.g requires += bison in bison.mpb).

        * config/ziparchive.mpb:

          Removed an extraneous comment.

        * templates/ghs.mpd:

          Changed the default primaryTarget to ppc_integrity.tgt and added
          <%exe_ext%> to <%exename%>.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * templates/ghs.mpd:
        * templates/ghscommon.mpt:

          Modified the ghs project type to support the 4.x version of the
          Multi IDE.  With this, the old .bld format has been removed.  This
          version assumes that Multi is being run on Windows.  If this is
          not the case, set the MPC_GHS_UNIX environment variable.

        * config/mfc.mpb:

          Used an else on the subsystem specific section instead of
          explicitly listing out the later versions of Visual C++.  When vc9
          is released, this file may not need to be modified.

        * config/openssl.mpb:

          Added nmake to the section related to Visual C++.

        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          Fixed a bug where template parser functions were seen as template
          variables to be documented.

        * docs/README:

          Clarified how the value for 'pure_libs' is interpreted.

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Updated support for the GHS compiler.

Wed Sep 13 15:24:45 UTC 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * templates/em3.mpd:
          Fix typo in the base address supplied to the linker. This is
          necessary to debug WinCE applications.

Wed Sep  6 16:20:27 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Backward compatibility was not complete for the 'install' keyword
          when scoped in a specific section.  The resolve_alias() method did
          not take scoping into account.

Thu Aug 31 23:18:57 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          Fixed a bug where variables found within a <%if()%> were not taken
          into account.

        * docs/templates/common.txt:

          Added some missing common template variable definitions.

        * docs/templates/make.txt:

          Defined all of the template variables specific to the make
          template.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where target output directories (exeout, dllout,
          libout) were not escaped if they included spaces.

        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Renamed dependencies to suppports_include which indicates whether
          a native version of make supports including files the may not
          exist at the time of make invocation.

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/em3.mpd:

        * templates/vc6.mpd:
        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Fixed a bug where the lib modifier was still applied to libraries
          specified by the 'libs' project variable even if the
          'use_lib_modifier' template variable was unset.

        * templates/bmakedll.mpt:

          Factored out the 'use_lib_modifier' and 'use_exe_modifier'
          template variables into common.mpt.

        * docs/MPC.sgml:
        * docs/README:
        * docs/USAGE:
        * modules/Options.pm:

          Updated incorrect documentation and added missing information.

        * modules/Driver.pm:

          Added a warning about the impending default type removal when no
          type is specified.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          Added the ability to force object files into a specific directory
          and added the ability to provide a "make include" file to override
          or augment makefile rules.

        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Converted whitespace to tabs as Visual Studio would used.

Mon Aug 21 09:12:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm (get_command_subs):
          Added crlf to the list, this can then be used in for example the
          prelink to have a multiline command. Thanks to Kees van Marle
          <kvmarle at remedy dot nl> for adding this.

Sat Aug 19 17:50:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:
          Added prelink as template variable, thanks to Kees van Marle
          <kvmarle at remedy dot nl> for adding this.

Sat Aug 19 01:22:51 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/MPC.sgml:

          Added this SGML document provided by Thomas Girard.  It contains
          information similar to that which is found in the USAGE file.

        * docs/USAGE:
        * modules/Options.pm:

          Cosmetic changes to the usage output.

        * modules/Driver.pm:

          Fixed a bug where an MPC configuration file that didn't exist
          would be chosen from the code base configuration file.

Wed Aug 16 22:22:31 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/USAGE:

          Added information to the logging section about the debug setting.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceHelper.pm:

          Added a method, perform_custom_processing, to WorkspaceHelper to
          allow users to be able to inject data into the workspace.

Tue Aug 15 23:50:48 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/USAGE:

          Fixed a minor typo.

        * modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Prefix the calls to cd with @ so that they are not printed during
          a make.

        * templates/vc8.mpd:
        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          Deprecated the 'install' keyword.  It has been replaced with
          'exeout' to be consistent with 'dllout' and 'libout'.  The use of
          'install' will still be accepted.

Wed Aug  9 15:11:23 2006  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm (expand_variables):

          Corrected a problem where "pre/" and "post/" include slashes
          were being changed to have the wrong type of slash.

Wed Aug  9 01:14:54 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          Corrected a bug where multiple variables used within a <%foreach%>
          would not be recognized correctly.

        * docs/USAGE:

          Clarified the documentation dealing with the MPC configuration
          files.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Print out AM_CONDITIONAL's for all of the features known to the
          FeatureParser.

        * modules/BMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where an assumption is made that projects in different
          directories were assumed to be relative.  When absolute
          directories are used, the Makefile would get confused about how to
          get back to the original directory.

        * modules/Driver.pm:

          Compare directories case-insensitively when running on a system
          that does not support case-sensitive file systems while searching
          for the correct MPC.cfg.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/DirectoryManager.pm:
        * modules/Options.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/StringProcessor.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Factored out and simplified code dealing with parsing assignments.

        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Corrected information about getting a dependency generator for
          nmake.

Thu Aug  3 02:45:12 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/templates:
        * docs/templates/common.txt:
        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          The script can be used to document all template variables found
          within a project template (.mpd file).  Currently, only the
          template variables that are common to most templates are
          documented.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added methods to get keywords for use within the devtools scripts.

        * highlight_template.pl:
        * devtools/highlight_template.pl:

          Moved this file into the devtools directory.

Fri Jul 28 15:13:01 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Corrected a bug introduced by my change from Fri Jul 14 17:25:16
          UTC 2006.  The original change was intended to deal with Windows'
          inability to have empty environment variables.  I have changed it
          to have a special case where then environment variable value of ""
          is interpreted as the users intent to have an empty string.

        * docs/LICENSE:
        * docs/README:
        * docs/USAGE:

          Moved these files from the root directory into the newly created
          docs directory.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Added a new template function, keyname_used, that is used in the
          automake template to handle the situation where a custom input
          file is used with more than one custom defined type.  If the
          custom input file caused more than one file to be generated in
          each custom defintion, the stamp file would be duplicated causing
          build errors.

Tue Jul 25 15:36:29 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * MPC version 3.4.0 released.
