	Elliot and Kitty B. for pointing out the problem and suggesting
	a fix.

	* config/boost_filesystem.mpb
	* config/boost_regex.mpb

	Scoped the lit_libs directive inside of a gnuace specific
	block to take advantage of automatic library resolution provided
	by the Windows version of boost.

        * README:
        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a new clause (expand) that can be used to set the expansion
          values of a particular variable.  This lets users define to what
          $(VAR_NAME) gets expanded within an mpc file.  See the README for
          more information.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added better support for OpenVMS.  This mainly entailed dealing
          with the .dir extension on directories and [] within wildcard
          specifications (as the OpenVMS glob() function does not handle
          these).

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where adding or subtracting a value with spaces would
          not work as expected.  When adding, the value would be split at
          each whitespace.  When subtracting, the value would never be
          removed.

          Setting a variable with spaces worked correctly.

Mon Nov 14 12:06:15 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Corrected a problem in the realclean target where .dll, .lib and
          .exp files would not be deleted unless pdbc or pdbl template
          variables were defined.

Mon Nov 14 09:50:38 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where a project name that conflicts with a directory
          name would not get mapped in cases where the directory had
          multiple levels.

Mon Nov 14 07:40:19 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where sorting the projects (with a circular
          dependency) would run infinitely.  This was identical to the
          problem fixed on Thu Apr 15 13:16:03 2004 just in a different
          scenario.

Thu Nov 10 12:23:43 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          When checking for duplicate source files in duplicate_index(),
          always use lowercase (since this is currently only used on
          Windows).

          Added a template variable, libname_prefix, that can be set to
          prefix all library names (sharedname, staticname and libs).  Note
          that lit_libs and pure_libs are not affected.

Mon Nov  7 10:15:31 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where a given custom input file does not match the
          custom defined input extensions and no source files are
          given, the generated source file name would still have the input
          file extension in the name (with an escaped period).

        * config/global.features
        * config/xerces.mpb

        Added a xerces feature to the xerces base project, similar to
        boost/zlib/zzip to allow disabling xerces specific projects.

Fri Oct 28 11:43:52 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/swig_perl.mpb:

          Added $(PERL5_INCLUDE) to the 'libpaths' as well as the 'includes'.

        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Corrected two instances of subdir_output which only show up if you
          set the template variable 'pdbc'.

Sun Oct 23 08:14:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
          Generate also includes for the resource compiler

        * config/boost_thread.mpb:
        * config/boost_unit_test_framework.mpb:

          Added a $(BOOST_STATIC_LIB_PREFIX) to the library name for all
          boost libraries.  For some reason, they insist on prepend 'lib' to
          the name of all static libraries on Windows.  For
          unit_test_framework, prg_exec_monitor and test_exec_monitor, 'lib'
          is always prepended on Windows since these are currently always
          static.  Thanks to Kevin Heifner for pointing this out.

Thu Oct 13 17:24:21 2005  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm: Add the 3 magic bytes to the start
          of the .sln file that allow double-clicking on the .sln file's icon
          to auto-start Visual Studio.

Mon Oct 10 07:02:30 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where mixed case template variables within a foreach
          context were not being evaluated case insensitively.  This made it
          appear that these variables were not being set.

        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Moved an endif to the correct location pertaining to precompiled
          headers.  Too much was being included within an if which depended
          upon the pch_header setting.

          Thanks to Thomas Rothfuss for reporting both of these bugs.

Fri Oct  7 13:50:49 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Change the way RCS/CVS Id is emitted so it's the same as how it
          is expanded in souces checked out with -kk option.  This allows
          us to regenerate ACE and TAO's Makefile.am files and only see
          the "real" differences.

Fri Oct  7 09:33:41 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Add support for custom file dependents.

Thu Oct  6 17:52:41 2005  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * templates/vc8.mpd:
        * templates/vc8dll.mpt:
        * templates/vc8exe.mpt:
        * templates/vc8lib.mpt:
        * templates/vc8libexe.mpt:
        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt (new file):
          Added support for building Windows CE/Mobile from Visual Studio 2005.
          By default, only the regular desktop Win32 configurations will be
          generated, as before. The CE/mobile platform names can be specified
          using -value_templates platforms="....". The possible platform
          names are listed in vc8platforms.mpt.

          To avoid overwriting outputs when building multiple platforms in
          the same ACE_wrappers directory, a platform can supply an
          output_subdir setting (see vc8platforms.mpt). If specified, vc8.mpd
          will use this in the Intermediate/OutputDirectory entries.

        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Improved MIDL support by adding generated files to the generated
          project to ensure that these generated files get cleaned up.

Fri Sep 30 07:46:54 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/BMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Corrected the directory changing code to take 2 or more deep
          relative paths into account.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for reporting this.

        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Optimized this template with respect to checking a variable before
          using foreach.  The foreach already does this, so checking the
          variable before hand is a waste of time.

Mon Sep 26 07:10:17 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added generic_pre_extension and generic_pre_filename custom build
          settings.

        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Added support for the builtin Visual Studio MIDL.

        * templates/vccommon.mpt:

          Added a comment that this file is not common to Visual C++, just
          vc6.

Thu Sep 22 12:43:43 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Changed to output libs, lit_libs, and pure_libs on separate
          lines.

Tue Sep 20 08:47:21 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/swig_perl.mpb:

          Added an include for $(PERL5_INCLUDE).

        * modules/TemplateInputReader.pm:

          Allow "()." in scope names within .mpt files.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Provide the user with more information as to why workspace
          creation failed.

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Shared libraries are created on Solaris using the -G option (not
          -shared).

Mon Sep 12 10:47:28 2005  Justin Michel  <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * clone_build_tree.pl:

          Prevent cloning of .pch files, which are precompiled headers when
          using VC++.

Thu Sep  8 08:06:18 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Changed to output compile_flags on separate lines.

          Changed to sort lists of source, header, and inline files
          to make output more deterministic.

Tue Sep  6 10:34:24 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/swig_perl.mpb:

          Added a base project for using SWIG with perl.

        * templates/vc7csharp.mpd:
        * templates/vc7vb.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Change the position of the use of custom 'output_option' setting.
          Ensure that the input file is the last thing on the command line.

Mon Aug 29 08:52:15 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/vc7.mpd:

          Enabled incremental linking as the default.

        * templates/vc7dll.mpt:
        * templates/vc7exe.mpt:

          Disable incremental linking in release mode as was done in
          Justin's change on Fri Aug 26 13:46:47 2005.

Mon Aug 29 12:41:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/nmakedll.mpt:
        * templates/nmakeexe.mpt:
          Added WinX86_64 as platform. This is Windows 64bit on EMT64.

Mon Aug 29 11:48:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/nmake.mpd:
          Made it possible to overrule cc, link and rc when generating the
          nmake project files

Fri Aug 26 14:32:48 2005  Justin Michel  <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * clone_build_tree.pl:

          Updated to prevent cloning of .suo files, which are used to store
          solution settings for VC++ 7+.

Fri Aug 26 13:46:47 2005  Justin Michel  <michel_j@ociweb.com>

        * templates/vc7libexe.mpt:
        * templates/vc8libexe.mpt:

          It is invalid to enable incremental linking on release builds,
          because we also enabled comdat folding and reference optimization.

Mon Aug 22 11:57:03 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Fixed a bug in the template that caused static projects to have
          incorrect project settings.

Mon Aug 22 07:17:17 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>
