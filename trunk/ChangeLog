        * templates/automake.mpd:

	  Changed to append <%pkgconfig_files%> to EXTRA_FILES.

	  Changed to append to pkgconfigdata_DATA.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Split the functionality of -expand_env into two options, -use_env
          and -expand_vars.

          If the -use_env option is supplied to mwc.pl or mpc.pl, then MPC
          will use environment variable to replace $() instances instead of
          the values provided by -relative.

          If the -expand_vars option is used, then MPC will expand $()
          variables to the exact value as found in the environment or the
          -relative settings (depending on the use of the -use_env option).

          Also, the -relative option can now accept relative paths.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Factored code common to the Project and Workspace creator dealing
          with the -into option into a method on the Creator for use in other
          modules.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/GHSWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/VC7WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Honor the -into option by prefixing each open and unlink with the
          correct output directory determined by the new method on the
          Creator.

        * modules/Options.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Allow multiple modifications of the same template variable.  Also,
          fixed a bug where not having an inputext would cause generated
          files not to be added.

        * modules/TemplateInputReader.pm:

          Allow redefintion of template input variables.

          Added a conditional include to each mpt file in of the following
          form:

          conditional_include "user_XXXXXX"

          where XXXXXX is the name of the current mpt file (without the
          extension).  This will allow a user to place custom configurations
          in an mpt file that will automatically be included during project
          generation, assuming that the file is located through the -include
          specification.

Mon Jan 10 13:58:37 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          If 'inputext' is not used in a Define_Custom, still create the
          custom type but provide no extensions.  This will not cause a
          warning when used when "automatic = 1", but nothing will be
          automatically added since no input extension was provide.

          Also, fixed a bug where if gendir is set for a particular file
          type in one scope, it would be applied to all files even in
          different scopes.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          Fixed a bug where the template repository directory wouldn't get
          created when necessary.

Mon Jan 10 10:55:51 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Added support for pkgconfig_files.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added pkgconfigdata_DATA to list of automake primaries we detect
          for converting = to +=.

Mon Jan 10 06:27:33 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Before using the project name as a regular expression, we must
          escape all of the regular expression specific characters.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/StringProcessor.pm:

          Moved the crlf and windows_crlf method into StringProcessor and
          finally fixed the problem with cygwin.  Now cygwin perl can be
          used with MPC.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Cache the contents of the template input files to avoid reading
          them multiple times.  Also, search for resource files that differ
          only in case from the project name.

        * modules/FeatureParser.pm:

          Cache the contents of the feature file to avoid reading it
          multiple times.

        * modules/Parser.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Took the file caching code out of TemplateParser and moved it into
          Parser so that more classes can use cached file reads than just
          the TemplateParser.


Wed Jan  5 11:24:36 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Fixed precompiled header problems where the pch source isn't in
          the current directory.  Also, changed the location of the
          intermediate files to use the project name instead of the project
          file without the extension.

          Refactored much repeated code into 3 distinct base modules.  There
          is now a MakeProjectBase, WinProjectBase and VCProjectBase.  Each
          contain methods that are common to Make base projects, Windows
          based projects and Visual C++ project types, respectively.

          Also, the 'win_version' template variable was factored out of the
          ProjectCreator subclasses and into the TemplateParser.

        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Only emit the library or exe setting if source files are provided.
          Thanks to Stephen Torri <storri@cse.wustl.edu> for suggesting
          this.

        * modules/WinVersionTranslator.pm:

          Truncate minor version numbers to 65535 or under as Visual C++ 6.0
          can't handle anything larger.

Tue Jan  4 07:48:20 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added code to support the use of nobase_include_HEADERS and
          nobase_pkginclude_HEADERS in the case where 'includedir' isn't
          set.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * templates/automake.mpd:
        * templates/automakedll.mpt:

          Added support for an 'includedir' template variable that can be
          used to override the default includedir setting determined by
          AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.  In order for header files for a
          particular project to be "installed", the 'install_headers'
          template variable needs to be set to 1.  Thanks to Stephen Torri
          <storri@cse.wustl.edu> for providing this functionality.

        * USAGE:
        * modules/MPC.pm:
        * modules/MWC.pm:

          Removed support for Visual Age 4.  It was incomplete, out-of-date
          and most likely didn't work at all.

        * modules/VA4ProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed these files.

          Added the ability to generate projects that only contain resource
          files.
