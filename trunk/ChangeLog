        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified the behavior of adding to prebuild, postbuild, and
          postclean.  Values that are added are now separated via the
          command separator for the project type.  This will assure that
          multiple commands are executed separately (and unconditionally).

        * docs/README:
        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a new keyword, postclean, which is similar to postbuild
          except that it is executed during the realclean target.

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/html.mpd:
        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Added the use of postclean.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          For the previous change to generate_default_components(), we only
          need to do this if the list of component tags was not provided to
          the method.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed an issue where a chain of three or more Custom_Define's
          would not have the right default input/output.

        * modules/CommandHelper.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified the helper to be keyed off of the define custom name
          instead of the define custom command name.

        * modules/CommandHelper.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a command helper that can be dynamically loaded to assist
          the project creator in determining which files will be generated
          by a command.  This is useful when the output of a file can not be
          represented by the usual Define_Custom syntax.

Mon Jun 30 14:55:51 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/StringProcessor.pm:

          Added a simple fgrep function that will find a string in an array
          reference.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where custom defines that generate output that can be
          used as automatic input to other custom defines did not work
          properly.  Now, they are automatically added when possible.

        * config/ixml.mpb:
        * config/upnp.mpb:

          Added base projects for use with the open source project Linux SDK
          for UPnP Devices.

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Split the functionality of the 'automatic' keyword into to two.
          'automatic_in' now specifies that input files are automatically
          added and 'automatic_out' specifies that generated output files
          are automatically added to the project.  These both default to
          true as 'automatic' did.  'automatic' is still accepted, but
          deprecated.

        * docs/README:

          Documented the following changes.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/VC7ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WinProjectBase.pm:

          Added the <%cmdsep%> pseudovariable that can be used in prebuild,
          postbuild, and postcommand.  It works like <%and%> and <%or%> but it
          unconditionally runs the right-hand side command.
          For postcommand, added <%input_dirname%> and <%output_dirname%> which
          work like their <%*_basename%> counterparts but return the directory
          portion of the file name.

Thu Jun 19 01:27:55 UTC 2008  James H. Hill  <hillj@isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * config/boost_system.mpb:

          Base project for using the Boost system library.

        * docs/templates/make.txt:

          Document the 'depgen_flags' template variable.

        * modules/WorkspaceHelper.pm:

          Removed unnecessary parenthesis around variable declarations.
          This provides a very minor performance increase due to reduced
          perl op codes.

        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Enhanced support for MinGW with "-type make".
