        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Made a tiny grammatical correction in an informational message.

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          When creating external dependencies, only create a full path using
          the output directory or current directory if the project name is
          not a full path itself.  Thank you to Manfred Peter <manfredpeter
          at siemens dot com> for finding and reporting this bug.

          Set same pdbc/pdbl settings to generate pdb files as we do
          with older vc versions

          With TAO we have the case that exe and dll have the same
          name which causes problems with the pdb file. Add a new
          use_pdb_modifier which we enable by default for vc1x, it
          adds _dll to the pdb file for a dll, and _exe to the pdb
          file for a exe
