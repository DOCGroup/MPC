        * docs/MPC.sgml:
        * docs/USAGE:
        * modules/Driver.pm:

          Added the ability to set the default type in the  MPC
          configuration file.

        * docs/README:
        * modules/VC7WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/VC8WebWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a new scope keyword, webapp, to allow users to specify web
          application directories.  Any directory specified within a webapp
          scope will be considered as a web application directory.
          Currently only the vc8 project type supports web application
          directories.

        * modules/ConfigParser.pm:

          Disallow empty names within the base configuration file (i.e.,
          $VAR that evaluates to empty).

Wed Nov 22 10:34:12 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * modules/BMakeWorkspaceCreator.mpc:
          Give the workspace a .bmak extension when using make_coexistence and
          simplified workspace_file_name()

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/bmakecommon.mpt:
          Removed support for the cbx compiler type which was the preview
          compiler shipped with CBuilderX.

Thu Nov 16 13:34:26 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a new feature, Modify_Custom, that can be used to customize
          an existing Define_Custom.

Thu Nov 16 12:25:18 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/global.features:
        * config/xalanc.mpb:

          Added support for Xalan-C++.  The xalanc feature is off by
          default.

        * modules/ConfigParser.pm:

          Support shell and make style environment variables.

Fri Nov 10 16:48:14 UTC 2006  Kevin Heifner  <heifner_k@ociweb.com>

        * docs/templates/vc7csharp.txt:
        * docs/templates/vc8csharp.txt:
        * templates/vc7csharp.mpd:
        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          Added a new template variable, 'keyfile', to support assembly
          signing.

Thu Nov  9 13:25:05 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/GHSWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Removed the -I. from the default project and added
          --one_instantiation_per_object.

Mon Nov  6 19:27:44 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/CCProjectCreator.pm:

          Code Composer checks the timestamp on the project file.  So, we
          need to compare the output to ensure that we don't update a
          project file that doesn't need to be.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where generated headers, inline files or template
          files would not be automatically added in the event that the user
          provided input for those types (i.e., Header_Files, Inline_Files,
          or Template_Files) that corresponds to a directory.  Now,
          specifying the following:

          Header_Files {
            some_dir_name
          }

          works as if the Header_Files section was not supplied, which is
          equivalent to the following:

          Header_Files {
            .
          }

          This pertains to automatic addition of generated files.

Mon Nov  6 15:11:47 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where unrecognized lines in 'specific' sections would
          not be flagged as an error.

        * modules/StringProcessor.pm (parse_assignment):

          Since template variable scopes can have spaces in the names, we
          must allow scopes to have spaces in the names here as well.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Put quotes around the variable name when displaying an invalid
          assignment name.  This allows spacing to be taken into account.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          The implementation for the 'targetoutdir' template variable was
          incorrect.  'targetoutdir' was not taken into account for the
          'libpaths' setting.

Thu Oct 26 15:45:18 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/templates/common.txt:
        * docs/templates/make.txt:
        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Renamed the prelink template variable to prelinktarget to avoid
          conflicting with prelink used in other templates.

        * docs/templates/vc7.txt:
        * docs/templates/vc7csharp.txt:
        * docs/templates/vc7vb.txt:
        * docs/templates/vc8csharp.txt:

          Documented the template variables for these existing project types
          and language combinations.

        * docs/templates/vc8vb.txt:
        * modules/VC8ProjectCreator.pm:
        * templates/vc8vb.mpd:
        * templates/vc8vb.mpt:

          Added initial support for Visual Basic with vc8.

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Support the prelink template variable as is done in vc7 and vc8.

        * templates/vc7.mpd:

          Modified the template to use PreprocessorDefinitions for
          midl_defines under the VCMIDLTool section instead of
          AdditionalOptions.

        * templates/vc7csharp.mpd:
        * templates/vc7csharp.mpt:
        * templates/vc7vb.mpd:
        * templates/vc7vb.mpt:
        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:
        * templates/vc8csharp.mpt:

          Changed the way the 'trace' template variable worked to be
          consistent between both vb and csharp with vc7 and vc8.

Thu Oct 19 17:29:08 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/GHSWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Modified to create an integrate file (for Integrity projects) and
          use it during the integration step.

Mon Oct 16 13:33:46 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/BDSWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/BMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/EM3WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/HTMLWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/MakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/VC6WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/VC71WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/VC7WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Use the create_command_line_string() method instead of printing
          the command line directly.  This opens the door for disabling this
          functionality.

        * mpc.pl:
        * mwc.pl:

          Removed the unused Config module.

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          For wrsppc, wrspentium, and ghsppc compilers, use $(CPUTYPE)
          instead of hard-coding the processor type.

        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Remove the 'output_subdir' template value from all library and
          executable output paths.

Wed Oct  4 17:08:21 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/GHSWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          For Integrity, a bsp file can not be added to the "Program"
          project, it must be added to the "INTEGRITY Application" project.
          So, for the ghs project type only, add .bsp files as documentation
          in the project and the bsp documentation files will be added as bsp
          files  when the integrate project is created.

Tue Oct  3 11:38:34 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Factored out the relative replacement code from the ProjectCreator
          into the Creator.  This required the addition of two template
          methods to get different sets of data for relative replacement to
          maintain the same functionality in the ProjectCreator and similar
          functionality in WorkspaceCreator.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where a previous scope of a foreach would hang around
          even when the scope went away.  This could cause strange results
          when nesting foreach's.

Tue Sep 26 21:02:46 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/templates/bmake.txt:

          Documented the template variables used by the bmake template.

        * templates/automake.mpd:
        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/em3.mpd:
        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/nmake.mpd:
        * templates/vc6.mpd:
        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc7csharp.mpd:
        * templates/vc7vb.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:
        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          If a custom definition has an 'output_option' set, the order of
          listing the input file changes such that it is listed before the
          output_option setting in the build rule.

Tue Sep 26 11:49:52 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          Fixed bugs where complex foreach's (with functions) would not be
          recognized and default template variable values would be
          lowercased.

        * docs/README:

          Clarified the 'exclude' usage.

        * docs/USAGE:
        * docs/templates/cc.txt:
        * docs/templates/common.txt:
        * modules/CCProjectCreator.pm:

        * templates/cccommon.mpt:
        * templates/ccexe.mpt:
        * templates/cclib.mpt:

          Added complete support for Code Composer 2.0.  This is an embedded
          application IDE for Windows only.

Fri Sep 22 14:00:10 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/GHSWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * docs/templates/ghs.txt:
        * templates/ghs.mpd:
        * templates/ghscommon.mpt:

          Fixed a couple of issues:

          1) Exceptions were hard-coded to be on for all projects.  It is
             now controlled by the 'exceptions' template variable and is on
             by default.
          2) If the primary target is Integrity, Program projects need an
             intermediate INTEGRITY Application project to perform the
             integration properly.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where getting the default value of a template variable
          was not case-insensitive as it should have been.

Wed Sep 20 16:26:48 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/bison.mpb:
        * config/flex.mpb:
        * config/lex.mpb:
        * config/yacc.mpb:

          Added a 'requires' setting for each base project matching the file
          name (e.g requires += bison in bison.mpb).

        * config/ziparchive.mpb:

          Removed an extraneous comment.

        * templates/ghs.mpd:

          Changed the default primaryTarget to ppc_integrity.tgt and added
          <%exe_ext%> to <%exename%>.

Tue Sep 19 13:04:15 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/MPC.sgml:
        * docs/USAGE:
        * docs/templates/ghs.txt:
        * modules/GHSProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/GHSWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * templates/ghs.mpd:
        * templates/ghscommon.mpt:

          Modified the ghs project type to support the 4.x version of the
          Multi IDE.  With this, the old .bld format has been removed.  This
          version assumes that Multi is being run on Windows.  If this is
          not the case, set the MPC_GHS_UNIX environment variable.

        * config/mfc.mpb:

          Used an else on the subsystem specific section instead of
          explicitly listing out the later versions of Visual C++.  When vc9
          is released, this file may not need to be modified.

        * config/openssl.mpb:

          Added nmake to the section related to Visual C++.

        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          Fixed a bug where template parser functions were seen as template
          variables to be documented.

        * docs/README:

          Clarified how the value for 'pure_libs' is interpreted.

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Updated support for the GHS compiler.

Wed Sep 13 15:24:45 UTC 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * templates/em3.mpd:
          Fix typo in the base address supplied to the linker. This is
          necessary to debug WinCE applications.

Wed Sep  6 16:20:27 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Backward compatibility was not complete for the 'install' keyword
          when scoped in a specific section.  The resolve_alias() method did
          not take scoping into account.

Thu Aug 31 23:18:57 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          Fixed a bug where variables found within a <%if()%> were not taken
          into account.

        * docs/templates/common.txt:

          Added some missing common template variable definitions.

        * docs/templates/make.txt:

          Defined all of the template variables specific to the make
          template.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where target output directories (exeout, dllout,
          libout) were not escaped if they included spaces.

        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Renamed dependencies to suppports_include which indicates whether
          a native version of make supports including files the may not
          exist at the time of make invocation.

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/em3.mpd:
        * templates/ghs.mpd:
        * templates/nmake.mpd:
        * templates/sle.mpd:
        * templates/vc6.mpd:
        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Fixed a bug where the lib modifier was still applied to libraries
          specified by the 'libs' project variable even if the
          'use_lib_modifier' template variable was unset.

        * templates/bmakedll.mpt:
        * templates/bmakedllexe.mpt:
        * templates/bmakelib.mpt:

        * templates/vc7libexe.mpt:
        * templates/vc8dll.mpt:
        * templates/vc8lib.mpt:

          Factored out the 'use_lib_modifier' and 'use_exe_modifier'
          template variables into common.mpt.

        * modules/Options.pm:

          Updated incorrect documentation and added missing information.

        * modules/Driver.pm:

          Added a warning about the impending default type removal when no
          type is specified.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          Added the ability to force object files into a specific directory
          and added the ability to provide a "make include" file to override
          or augment makefile rules.

        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Converted whitespace to tabs as Visual Studio would used.

Mon Aug 21 09:12:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm (get_command_subs):
          Added crlf to the list, this can then be used in for example the
          prelink to have a multiline command. Thanks to Kees van Marle
          <kvmarle at remedy dot nl> for adding this.

Sat Aug 19 17:50:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:
          Added prelink as template variable, thanks to Kees van Marle
          <kvmarle at remedy dot nl> for adding this.

Sat Aug 19 01:22:51 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/MPC.sgml:

          Added this SGML document provided by Thomas Girard.  It contains
          information similar to that which is found in the USAGE file.

        * docs/USAGE:
        * modules/Options.pm:

          Cosmetic changes to the usage output.

        * modules/Driver.pm:

          Fixed a bug where an MPC configuration file that didn't exist
          would be chosen from the code base configuration file.

Wed Aug 16 22:22:31 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/USAGE:

          Added information to the logging section about the debug setting.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceHelper.pm:

          Added a method, perform_custom_processing, to WorkspaceHelper to
          allow users to be able to inject data into the workspace.

Tue Aug 15 23:50:48 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/USAGE:

          Fixed a minor typo.

        * modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Prefix the calls to cd with @ so that they are not printed during
          a make.

        * docs/README:

        * templates/vc7vb.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:
        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          Deprecated the 'install' keyword.  It has been replaced with
          'exeout' to be consistent with 'dllout' and 'libout'.  The use of
          'install' will still be accepted.

Wed Aug  9 15:11:23 2006  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm (expand_variables):

          Corrected a problem where "pre/" and "post/" include slashes
          were being changed to have the wrong type of slash.

        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          Corrected a bug where multiple variables used within a <%foreach%>
          would not be recognized correctly.

        * docs/USAGE:

          Clarified the documentation dealing with the MPC configuration
          files.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Print out AM_CONDITIONAL's for all of the features known to the
          FeatureParser.

        * modules/BMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/NMakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where an assumption is made that projects in different
          directories were assumed to be relative.  When absolute
          directories are used, the Makefile would get confused about how to
          get back to the original directory.

        * modules/Driver.pm:

          Compare directories case-insensitively when running on a system
          that does not support case-sensitive file systems while searching
          for the correct MPC.cfg.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/DirectoryManager.pm:
        * modules/Options.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/StringProcessor.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Factored out and simplified code dealing with parsing assignments.

        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Corrected information about getting a dependency generator for
          nmake.

        * docs/templates:
        * docs/templates/common.txt:
        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          The script can be used to document all template variables found
          within a project template (.mpd file).  Currently, only the
          template variables that are common to most templates are
          documented.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added methods to get keywords for use within the devtools scripts.

        * highlight_template.pl:
        * devtools/highlight_template.pl:

          Moved this file into the devtools directory.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Corrected a bug introduced by my change from Fri Jul 14 17:25:16
          UTC 2006.  The original change was intended to deal with Windows'
          inability to have empty environment variables.  I have changed it
          to have a special case where then environment variable value of ""
          is interpreted as the users intent to have an empty string.

        * docs/LICENSE:
        * docs/README:
        * docs/USAGE:

          Moved these files from the root directory into the newly created
          docs directory.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Added a new template function, keyname_used, that is used in the
          automake template to handle the situation where a custom input
          file is used with more than one custom defined type.  If the
          custom input file caused more than one file to be generated in
          each custom defintion, the stamp file would be duplicated causing
          build errors.
