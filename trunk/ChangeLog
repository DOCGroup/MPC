        * modules/CommandHelper.pm:

          Fixed a comment.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Delay replacing <%...%> that contain project keywords until they
          are used by the template.  Doing this allows the values to be used
          regardless of the order in which keywords are processed within the
          project.

Tue Jul 15 16:08:40 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/CommandHelper.pm:

          Extended the interface to allow the helper to provide "tied"
          custom files.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Made the following changes:

          1) Added an optimization to generated_source_listed() to avoid
             attempting to add custom generated files if they couldn't
             possibly be generated.
          2) Added the ability for a command helper to "tie" files together
             so that they are processed closely together.
          3) Fixed a bug where an output file could end up being listed more
             than once in the custom output files value.

        * vs_postclean.pl:

          &quot; becomes ", not '.

Fri Jul 11 15:18:27 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:

          Cleaned up some typos (stray semicolons)

        * vs_postclean.pl:

          Restore current directory after changing it.
          Translate &amp;, etc.
          Added support for solutions, all referenced projects will be cleaned.

Fri Jul 11 14:56:44 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a pseudo template variable, rmdir, which will be defined
          depending upon the project type.  It will be 'rmdir /s/q' on
          Windows and 'rm -rf' on UNIX.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where the configure.ac.Makefiles did not contain the
          correct names if the -name_modifier option was used.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Reduced op code count.

Fri Jul 11 14:30:53 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a pseudo template variable, slash, which will be defined
          depending upon the project type.

        * templates/make.net.mpt:
        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Rely on the slash psuedo template variable instead of defining one
          in these template input files.

Fri Jul 11 11:10:00 UTC 2008  Simon Massey  <sma at prismtech dot com>

        * templates/make.net.mpt:

          Added dollar-Id-dollar to appease a non-MPC related script that, for
          some reason, insists on applying it's influence on MPC.

Thu Jul 10 22:34:12 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * vs_postclean.pl:

          Added a script to perform the postclean step for Visual Studio
          projects.

        * modules/Depgen/ObjectGenerator.pm:
        * modules/Depgen/ObjectGeneratorFactory.pm:
        * modules/Depgen/Preprocessor.pm:

          Cleaned up the code and reduced op code count.

        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Added a VCPostCleanEventTool, which doesn't exist in Visual
          Studio, to hold the 'postclean' settings.  This is mainly here to
          enable another script to come along and perform the postclean
          function.

Thu Jul 10 18:28:33 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a new feature, pre_dirname, which is similar to pre_filename
          except that the value is prepended to the output directory for
          generated files.  If a separate directory is desired, the
          pre_dirname setting should end in a slash.

Thu Jul 10 15:28:50 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * devtools/document_template.pl:

          Fixed a bug where template variables used within template
          functions were ignored.

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added the ability to utilize project settings within the
          Define_Custom command, commandflags, dependent, output_option,
          and postcommand settings.

Thu Jul 10 14:29:44 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/make.net.mpd:
        * templates/make.net.mpt:
        * docs/templates/make.net.txt:

          Added support for compiling C# code using Mono.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/StringProcessor.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * modules/VC9ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/VC9WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Decreased op code count.

        * modules/AutomakeProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/MakeProjectBase.pm:
        * modules/Parser.pm:

          Reduce op code count.

        * modules/CommandHelper.pm:

          Added a debug message to assist users in figuring out why their
          helper isn't being picked up.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Modified recursive_directory_list() to skip .svn and CVS
          directories.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a very old and incorrect assumption that output file names
          generated as part of a custom definition had to be longer than the
          length of the input file name.

Tue Jul  8 15:35:29 UTC 2008  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * templates/vc8.mpd: Allow a project to be a "make output" type using
          the VCNMakeTool section instead of the usual compile, link, etc.
          sections. This allows one to drive nmake-type projects from a
          VC project. Also, enable setting the DebugInformationFormat even
          when doing an optimize/Release build. Thanks to Kelly Hickel for
          contributing these.

Tue Jul  8 13:09:22 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug in my change from Thu Jul  3 11:46:23 UTC 2008.  Files
          were not being automatically added when they didn't exist on the
          file system.

Mon Jul  7 17:00:33 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          MPC had always assumed that output files went into the same
          directory as the input file (unless specified otherwise through
          gendir).  Now, in the Define_Custom for the command, this
          assumption can be modified.  If 'output_follows_input' is set to
          0, it will assume that output files go into the same directory as
          the project (unless specified otherwise through gendir).

Mon Jul  7 13:10:46 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified the behavior of adding to prebuild, postbuild, and
          postclean.  Values that are added are now separated via the
          command separator for the project type.  This will assure that
          multiple commands are executed separately (and unconditionally).

Thu Jul  3 16:36:30 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:
        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a new keyword, postclean, which is similar to postbuild
          except that it is executed during the realclean target.

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/html.mpd:
        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Added the use of postclean.

Thu Jul  3 14:49:52 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          For the previous change to generate_default_components(), we only
          need to do this if the list of component tags was not provided to
          the method.

Thu Jul  3 11:46:23 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed an issue where a chain of three or more Custom_Define's
          would not have the right default input/output.

Wed Jul  2 16:35:22 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/CommandHelper.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified the helper to be keyed off of the define custom name
          instead of the define custom command name.

Wed Jul  2 14:04:39 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/CommandHelper.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a command helper that can be dynamically loaded to assist
          the project creator in determining which files will be generated
          by a command.  This is useful when the output of a file can not be
          represented by the usual Define_Custom syntax.

Mon Jun 30 14:55:51 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/StringProcessor.pm:

          Added a simple fgrep function that will find a string in an array
          reference.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where custom defines that generate output that can be
          used as automatic input to other custom defines did not work
          properly.  Now, they are automatically added when possible.

Fri Jun 27 12:59:39 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/ixml.mpb:
        * config/upnp.mpb:

          Added base projects for use with the open source project Linux SDK
          for UPnP Devices.

        * docs/README:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Split the functionality of the 'automatic' keyword into to two.
          'automatic_in' now specifies that input files are automatically
          added and 'automatic_out' specifies that generated output files
          are automatically added to the project.  These both default to
          true as 'automatic' did.  'automatic' is still accepted, but
          deprecated.

Wed Jun 25 21:38:16 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * docs/README:

          Documented the following changes.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/VC7ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WinProjectBase.pm:

          Added the <%cmdsep%> pseudovariable that can be used in prebuild,
          postbuild, and postcommand.  It works like <%and%> and <%or%> but it
          unconditionally runs the right-hand side command.
          For postcommand, added <%input_dirname%> and <%output_dirname%> which
          work like their <%*_basename%> counterparts but return the directory
          portion of the file name.

Thu Jun 19 01:27:55 UTC 2008  James H. Hill  <hillj@isis.vanderbilt.edu>

        * config/boost_system.mpb:

          Base project for using the Boost system library.

Tue Jun 17 17:16:07 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/templates/make.txt:

          Removed unnecessary parenthesis around variable declarations.
          This provides a very minor performance increase due to reduced
          perl op codes.

Tue Jun 10 14:45:18 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Enhanced support for MinGW with "-type make".

Fri May 30 15:54:22 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>
