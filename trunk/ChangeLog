        * templates/make.mpd:

          Extend the DEPLIBS handling of static libraries to workspaces
          that don't use -static and have a mix of static and shared.
          With this change, shared libs and executables will be re-linked
          when the static libs they use are changed.
          Also, make sure postbuild doesn't run in parallel with the normal
          build steps and use "-include" to suppress warnings (gnu make only).

          kept separately for each directory of input files.

Thu Mar  8 06:50:28 UTC 2011  Martin Corino  <mcorino@remedy.nl>

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fix to solve problems with IDL projects using the combination of
          setting 'gendir' and defining custom output files (in separate
          directory/ies *not* equal to 'gendir').

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Modified MPC to generate projects in separate processes.
          This experimental feature is enabled with the
          command-line option '-workers.' It's behavior can
          be modified with the '-workers_dir' and '-workers_port'
          directives.

          This is a merge of work done in the 'mpc_performance' branch.

        * modules/VC11WorkspaceCreator.pm:
          Added vc11 type, looks like the project format is still the same
          as with vc10, but this way we can use -type vc11 in some experimental
          builds

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where the inner-most template scope was usable at any
          given point within a template.  Thanks to Adam Mitz for helping me

          users to control whether or not a .NOTPARALLEL is added to the
          makefile.

        * rpm/MPC.templ:

        * rpm/MPC.spec:
          Renamed the MPC spec file template to .templ and update the script
          to read the template and create MPC.spec. Within a source package
          we can only have one spec file and MPC is also included in the A/T/C/D
          source package which will result in two spec files

Tue Sep 20 13:34:11 UTC 2011  James H. Hill  <hillj at cs dot iupui dot edu>

        * config/tena_middleware.mpb:

Mon Aug  1 18:16:21 UTC 2011  James H. Hill  <hillj at cs dot iupui dot edu>

        * config/pintools_32bit.mpb:

          New base project for building a Pintool. This base project
          only supports 32-bit Linux and Windows operating systems.

Thu Jun 30 06:58:25 UTC 2011  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Thu Jun 16 20:16:29 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * templates/vc10.mpd:

          When creating static libs, don't provide dependent libs as the
          AdditionalDependencies for the lib tool.  This change makes
          static libs in vc10 work like vc9 (and -type make for that matter).
          Before this, a library that depended on another would end up
          including all of the dependent lib's object files.

Fri Jun 10 14:51:32 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Options.pm:

          Modification to previous commit: also handle duplicate slashes and
          other path cleanup operations.

        * templates/vc10.mpd:

          Unlike previous versions, vc10 runs all custom build steps for the
          project in the same cmd shell.  Use setlocal/endlocal when adding
          to the PATH to avoid redundant additions to PATH.

Tue May 24 14:42:55 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Options.pm:

          Trim any trailing slashes from input files (really directories)
          provided on the command line.  Leaving the trailing slash
          can result in the wrong number of ".." components in relative
          path expansions.

Thu May 19 15:29:01 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * config/glib.mpb:

          Allow customization of the include search path for GLib since
          at least some 64-bit Linux distros use "lib64" in place of "lib".

Tue May 17 15:32:48 UTC 2011  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

          Added debug information about the possible base projects that are
          available.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where subtracting values that contain psuedo variables
          failed because they were not evaluated before subtracting.

Wed Apr 27 14:31:56 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * modules/MakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Due to the change below, the workspace makefile no longer needs
          to explicitly invoke the "generated" target in the projects.

Wed Apr 27 14:07:44 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * templates/make.mpd:

          In the custom-only case, make sure that "all" is the first target
          listed, and also have the "generated" target invoke prebuild.

Wed Apr 27 13:25:32 UTC 2011  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

Sun Apr 10 12:07:15 UTC 2011  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:
          Removed CCK related options, this way someone can use NDDS without
          requiring him to use the CCK, if you need the cck support, use
          ndds_cck_ts_defaults as new base

Sat Apr  9 11:47:11 UTC 2011  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/ndds_cck_ts_defaults.mpb:
          New base project, ndds_ts_defaults will be changed soon for just RTI
          DDS without the CCK support. If you want to use the CCK, derive
          from this base project

        * config/nddsmonitor.mpb:
          Layout change

Fri Apr  8 14:35:18 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          Added "UserControl" as a valid subtype setting for C#.

        * config/coredx_ts_defaults.mpb:
        * config/coredxlib.mpb:
          Starter files for CoreDX

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fuzz fix.

Tue Apr  5 18:47:09 UTC 2011  Don Hudson  <hudsond@ociweb.com>

       * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

         Added default_verbose_ordering() that returns false
         and used it to set verbose_ordering.  This allows derived workspace
         creators to override the default verbose ordering.

         Fixed typo in comment.

         Corrected Perl warning by replacing == with eq in an if statement.

         Modified the verbose ordering warning message to include the name
         of the project being processed.

       * modules/Driver.pm:

          Changed to set verbose ordering on the creator only if it's defined
          in the config file.

        * modules/RpmSpecWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added default_verbose_ordering() that returns true so that
          a warning is logged if there are missing dependencies when
          generating an rpm spec file.

Tue Apr  5 12:57:22 UTC 2011  Don Hudson  <hudsond@ociweb.com>

        * docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html:

          Added bracketed (multiline) assigments to documentation,
          i.e., assignment of form:

          keyword <operator> [optional flags] {
                    This is
                    a multiline assignment.
          }

          Optional flags are \s to retain leading white space and
          \n to retain new lines.  These flags are be combined.

        * docs/templates/rpmspec.txt:

          Added rpm_pre_cmd keyword for %pre section of the RPM spec file
          and rpm_url for the URL tag in the RPM spec file.

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed to default to cacheok of false as some intermediate project
          files are deleted must be regenerated if a project is regenerated.
          This was causing an error, but the error was only being logged.

          Changed to return an error code and message when workspace generation
          fails in some cases where an error message was only logged.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Added parse_assignment() that pre-parses bracketed assigments
          (see comment on docs/html/MakeProjectCreator.html) before
          calling SUPER::parse_assignment(). This method takes an optional
          file handle that must be used for bracketed assignment support.

        * modules/DirectoryManager.pm:

          Corrected typo in comment.

        * modules/Parser.pm:

          Added strip_comments(), strip_lt_whitespace(), and is_blank_line().

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added file handle parse_assignment and related method calls for
          bracketed assignment support.  See comment on modules/Creator.pm.

          Added case sensitivity logic to already_added() similar to other places in code.

        * modules/RpmSpecWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Changed write_and_compare_file() to return 1 instead of undef as method
          must now return status.

          Added %pre section and URL tag to RPM spec file generation.

        * modules/StringProcessor.pm:

          Changed parse_assignment() to not strip ending new line
          as later parsing may need it.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added file handle parse_assignment and related method calls for
          bracketed assignment support.  See comment on modules/Creator.pm.

          Changed to return an error code and message when workspace generation
          fails in some cases where an error message was only logged.

          Added default_cacheok() which returns true and is used to set 'cacheok'
          so this method can be overridden when 'cacheok' needs to be false.

        * docs/templates/vc8csharp.txt:
        * templates/vc8csharp.mpd:

          Added the "PlatformTarget" template variable for C#.

Tue Mar 15 14:54:48 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * templates/vc10.mpd:
        * docs/templates/vc10.txt:

          Added the "PlatformToolset" template variable.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * docs/README:

          Allow the "*" replacement for assignments to the libs keyword.

Wed Mar  9 13:51:00 UTC 2011  William R. Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * config/ndds_ts_defaults.mpb:

          Added PLATFORM_NDDS_ARGS at the suggestion of Johnny Willemsen.

Thu Mar  3 18:51:23 UTC 2011  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * docs/html/RpmSpec.html:

          Fixed html errors and warnings.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where a project added by an aggregated workspace
          containing a relative path would not be recognized as a duplicate
          if the same project were added by another workspace without a
          relative path.
