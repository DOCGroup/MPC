        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Added support for setting the install location of a set of
          files for a project using 'install_location'. This takes a
          comma separated list of directories that represent the location
          for installing the files. The following is a simple example:

            specific (wix) {
              install_location = etc models
            }

          The example above will install files for the given project
          in etc/models directory under the root install directory.

        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Added support for installing GME components using Wix. In order
          to include GME components in the installer, you must define the
          following properties in a *wix* scope:

            gme_install     = [0 | 1]; default is 0
            gme_register    = [HKLM | HKCU]; default is HKLM
            gme_progid      = <program id>
            gme_uuid        = <uuid>
            gme_paradigms   = <space separated list>
            gme_has_icon    = [0 | 1]
            gme_description = <descrption of component>
            gme_tooltip     = <tooltip for component>

          The values for each of these properties can be found in
          ComponentConfig.h

        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Added support to creating a directory if there is no output
          file specified in the project.

          Disabled skipping projects if there are no useful targets
          defined.

          Added markers to the top and bottom of the component. The
          name of the markers are: component_top and component_bottom.

        * modules/WixWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * templates/wix.mpd:
        * templates/wix.mpt:

          . First version of the Wix module that is used in conjuction
            with the Wix toolset that creates .msi files. This project
            type will generate the include files (.wxi) that can be included
            in a .wxs configuration file.

            Right now, the installer only can generate files for
            shared libraries. The next update will include support for
            executables.

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed hard-coded 'resource_files' to a call to get_resource_files,
          which is a new method on ProjectCreator.  get_resource_files
          determines the name of 'resource_files' for the current language
          based on the %language hash (for C# and VB this is 'resx_files').
