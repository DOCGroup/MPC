        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Corrected a bug introduced by my change from Fri Jul 14 17:25:16
          UTC 2006.  The original change was intended to deal with Windows'
          inability to have empty environment variables.  I have changed it
          to have a special case where then environment variable value of ""
          is interpreted as the users intent to have an empty string.

        * docs/README:
        * docs/USAGE:

          Moved these files from the root directory into the newly created
          docs directory.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Added a new template function, keyname_used, that is used in the
          automake template to handle the situation where a custom input
          file is used with more than one custom defined type.  If the
          custom input file caused more than one file to be generated in
          each custom defintion, the stamp file would be duplicated causing
          build errors.
