//
// Please try to keep this alphabetically sorted.
//
add_references = If this is set, the project will be generated with project references based on the 'after' keyword setting.
basicruntimechecks = This corresponds to the C/C++ Code Generation property "Basic Runtime Checks". The numeric value specifies the pull-down value in the IDE.
buffersecuritycheck = This corresponds to the C/C++ Code Generation property "Buffer Security Check". The boolean value specifies the pull-down value in the IDE.
charset = This setting specifies the "Character Set" in the General properties. The values 0, 1, and 2 specify Not Set, Unicode, and Multi-Byte respectively.
common_defines = Specifies macros that are common to all target types.
culture = This corresponds to the Resources General property "Culture". The numeric value corresponds to the pull-down values in the IDE.
debug_format = This setting specifies the "Debug Information Format" found in the C/C++ General properties. The numeric value specifies the pull-down value in the IDE.
debug_prj = This is an internally used template variable to determine if the configuration originated as "Debug". In the event that the 'optimize' template variable is overridden, debug_prj allows the correct run-time library to be chosen.
defines = Macros that are specific to a particular configuration.
detect64bitportabilityproblems = This corresponds to the C/C++ Code Generation property "Detect 64-bit Portability Issues". The boolean value specifies the pull-down value in the IDE.
enablefunctionlevellinking = This corresponds to the C/C++ Code Generation property "Enable Function-Level Linking". The boolean value specifies the pull-down value in the IDE.
encoding = Specifies the XML encoding for the generated .vcproj file.
fixedbaseaddress = This corresponds to the Linker Advanced property "Fixed Base Address". The values 1 and 2 correspond to Relocatable (not fixed) and Load at a Fixed Address respectively.
generatemapfile = This corresponds to the Linker Debugging property "Generate Map File". The boolean value specifies the pull-down value in the IDE.
guid = The value for this variable is generated during project generation.
ignore_default_library_names = The value for this is evaluated as a space separated list of default library names to ignore. It corresponds to the Linker Input property "Ignore Specific Library".
ignorealldefaultlibraries = Ignore all default libraries during linking.
inlinefunctionexpansion = This corresponds to the C/C++ Optimization property "Inline Function Expansion". A value of 1 indicates /Ob1 (inline only those designated to be inlined). A value of 2 indicates /Ob2 (inline any suitable function).
link_options = Allows passing arbitrary options to the linker.
linkincremental = This setting corresponds to the Linker General property "Enable Incremental Linking". The values 1 and 2 correspond to NO and YES respectively.
midl_defines = Macros specified here correspond to the MIDL General property "Preprocessor Definitions".
midl_flags = The value for this variable is passed to the MIDL command as "Additional Options".
midl_includes = This correspond to the MIDL General property "Additional Include Directories".
midl_notlb = Suppresses the creation of a type library for the IDL file.
minimalrebuild = This corresponds to the C/C++ Code Generation property "Enable Minimal Rebuild". The boolean value specifies the pull-down value in the IDE.
moduledefinitionfile = This setting corresponds to the Linker Input property "Module Definition File".
output_subdir = This is used in determining the sub-directory under which intermediate files will be placed.
pdbc = If this boolean template variable is set, the C/C++ Output Files property "Program Database File Name" will be set according to the project target.
pdbl = If this boolean template variable is set, the Linker Debugging property "Generate Program Database File" will be set according to the project target.
platform = Specifies the target platform.
runtime_library = This corresponds to the C/C++ Code Generation property "Runtime Library". If the template variable is set, the numeric value will be used. Otherwise, it will be determined based on the target and debug/optimize configuration. The numeric value specifies the pull-down value in the IDE.
stringpooling = This corresponds to the C/C++ Code Generation property "Enable String Pooling". The boolean value specifies the pull-down value in the IDE.
subsystem = This corresponds to the Linker System property "SubSystem".  This variable should not be set directly by the user; instead the project should inherit from 'mfc'.
unicode = If this boolean template variable is set, the UNICODE and _UNICODE macros are added to the C/C++ Preprocessor property "Preprocessor Definitions".
unicode_mfc_entry = This corresponds to the Linker Advanced property "Entry Point".  This variable should not be set directly by the user; instead the project should inherit from 'mfc'.
vcprojecttype = Specifies the ProjectType setting within the generated .vcproj file.
vcversion = Specifies the version of the generated .vcproj file.  This value is determined by the VC8ProjectCreator.
warning_level = This setting corresponds to the C/C++ General property "Warning Level". Valid values are 0 through 4.
xml_version = Specifies the XML version for the generated .vcproj file.
