lib_prefix = The dynamic and static library prefix.  The value for this depends on the project type.
libname_prefix = This is a prefix that will be prepended to the actual library name (ex. libXY.so where X is libname_prefix and Y is sharedname).

pch_defines = C preprocessor macros that indicate that precompiled headers will be used.
platforms = This determines for which platform the project will be built.
type_is_binary = This will be true is the project is a dynamic library or an executable.
