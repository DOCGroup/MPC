<p class="Body">
Starting with ACE/TAO x.6.3 it is possible to generate project files
for the WindRiver Workbench version 2.6 (VxWorks 6.4). We have validated
the MPC support for the ACE lib, TAO libs and the TAO tests.
</p>
<p class="Body">With VxWorks we have to do a cross build. The first step is to setup a host
build, from this host build we use the gperf and TAO_IDL tools
in the cross build.
</p>
<p class="Body">The Workbench is using eclipse as framework and then has several
WindRiver specific extensions. Part of the generation done by
MPC is then specifically for the WindRiver tools, part is for the
eclipse environment. The Workbench uses the fixed project filenames
<em class="Code">.project</em>, <em class="Code">.wrproject</em>, and <em class="Code">.wrmakefile</em>.
In the <em class="Code">.project</em> file the files in the project are listed,
in the <em class="Code">.wrproject</em> the compiler and linker flags are
defined, and in the <em class="Code">.wrmakefile</em> the custom build rules
are defined, like triggering the IDL compiler.</p>
<p class="Body">By default the files are generated in the same directory as the MPC file.
When you have multiple projects in one directory you have to add
<em class="Code">-make_coexistence</em> to the invocation of <em class="Code">mwc.pl</em>
Then for each project a new subdirectory will be created to
store the files the workbench needs. If you run <em class="Code">mwc.pl -make_coexistence</em> from the
ACE_wrappers directory you will get a lot of subdirectories in your tree.
</p>
<p class="Body">
By default we generate for the flexible build support, when you want to use
standard build use <em class="Code">-value_template standard_build=1</em>.
</p>
<p class="Body">
To get a project with all dependencies create a new workspace file, f.e. vxworks.mwc
<blockquote>
<p class="Code">workspace(vxworks) {</p>
<p class="Code">&nbsp;&nbsp;ace</p>
<p class="Code">&nbsp;&nbsp;TAO/tao</p>
<p class="Code">&nbsp;&nbsp;TAO/tests/Hello</p>
<p class="Code">}</p>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p class="Body">
You should generate the project files
from a VxWorks development shell or should have executed the wrenv script. With x.6.4 or newer
you do execute:
<blockquote>
<p class="Code">set ACE_ROOT=your_path</p>
<p class="Code">cd %ACE_ROOT%</p>
<p class="Code">perl %ACE_ROOT%\bin\mwc.pl vxworks.mwc -type wb26 -make_coexistence</p>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p class="Body">
After you have generated the project files you have to import them
into your current Workbench workspace with the following steps
<ul>
<li><p class="Body">Open the workbench</p></li>
<li><p class="Body">Select File, Import, General, Existing Projects into Workspace</p></li>
<li><p class="Body">Select your ACE_ROOT directory and let the Workbench search for projects</p></li>
<li><p class="Body">Select now the projects you want to import in the Projects list and select Finish</p></li>
<li><p class="Body">After importing close the workbench</p></li>
<li><p class="Body">Copy the prefs file to its location, see below</p></li>
<li><p class="Body">Start the workbench again</p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="Body">The build order of the projects is stored in an eclipse file that
is generated as workspace by the <em class="Code">wb26</em> generator. After
you have imported the projects into the Workbench close it and then
copy the generated <em class="Code">org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs</em> file to
the <em class="Code">.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.runtime\.settings</em>
directory of the Workbench and then restart the workbench again. Do note
that the build order can only be generated for the projects that are listed
in the MPC workspace. The other option is to use subprojects to which
you can enable with <em class="Code">-value_template enable_subprojects=1</em>. There is a bug
in Workbench 2.6/3.0 related to the build order, it is ignored if you use
<em class="Code">wrws_update</em> to build the workspace from the commandline.</p>
<p class="Body">When compiling TAO you need to have tao_idl and gperf available. You can copy tao_idl and
gperf manually to the ACE_wrappers\bin directory of your target build or you can specify an
alternative tao_idl when generating the workspace like below.
<blockquote>
<p class="Code">perl %ACE_ROOT%\bin\mwc.pl vxworks.mwc -type wb26 -value_template tao_idl=$(HOST_TAO_IDL)</p>
<p class="Code">perl %ACE_ROOT%\bin\mwc.pl vxworks.mwc -type wb26 -value_template tao_idl=c:\tmp\tao_idl</p>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p class="Body">When using the <em class="Code">-expand_vars</em> by default only the environment variables which match
the wildcard <em class="Code">*_ROOT</em> are expanded. If you want to get other environment variables expanded (like <em class="Code">WIND_BASE</em>)
you can specify these through the <em class="Code">-relative</em> argument or use a file that you specify with <em class="Code">
-relative_file</em>. For example you can use the following relative_file which expands the environment variables
listed.
<blockquote>
<p class="Code">*_ROOT</p>
<p class="Code">TAO_ROOT, $ACE_ROOT/TAO</p>
<p class="Code">CIAO_ROOT, $TAO_ROOT/CIAO</p>
<p class="Code">*_BASE</p>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p class="Body">
We do have some limitations at this moment because of restrictions in MPC or the Workbench. We are working
on resolving the MPC restrictions, the Workbench restrictions have been reported to WindRiver and are already
converted to enhancement requests. It is important to get these enhancement requests implemented by
WindRiver. As user you can have impact on the importancy of these enhancement requests, create a new TSR
for WindRiver and ask WindRiver to implement these enhancement requests. Pleas let us know that you have
done this so that we can inform our local WindRiver contacts. We also have a large list of POSIX enhancement
requests, if you are interested in more POSIX compliance contact us to get this list.

<ul>
<li><p class="Body">You need to close the workbench when generating the project files. The WB doesn't detect that the .project/.wrproject/org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs files got changed on disk (WIND00116553)</p></li>
<li><p class="Body">You need to import, close, and then change the build order file (WIND00116553)</p></li>
<li><p class="Body">When using includes/recursive_includes do not use . as path, but an environment variable which can be expanded to a full path (combined WB/MPC restriction)</p></li>
<li><p class="Body">We need to generate full paths in the .project file because WB doesn't support relative files like ../MyHeader.h (WIND00116641)</p></li>
<li><p class="Body">There is no dependency between the IDL file and the resulting *C.{h,cpp,inl} and *S.{h,cpp,inl} files. This is because the IDL compiler
can't be integrated as a real build tool because a custom clean step can't be defined (WIND00117037)</p></li>
