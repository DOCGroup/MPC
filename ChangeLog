        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Do not make a copy of the flag overrides hash when the files are
          part of the same component group.  We make the copy later on when
          we are modifying the overrides for tied files.

Mon Jan  6 06:21:29 UTC 2020  Chad Elliott  <elliottc@objectcomputing.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Make a copy of the flag override hash when connecting it to a
          file so that we do not inadvertantly modify multiple flag overrides
          when modifying flag overrides for a single file.

Mon Jul  1 18:35:43 UTC 2019  Chad Elliott  <elliottc@objectcomputing.com>

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Check the result of file_sorter() since it does not return
          true/false, it returns -1,0,1.

Fri Jun 28 15:52:37 UTC 2019  Chad Elliott  <elliottc@objectcomputing.com>

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added a template function, is_custom_input, which takes a file
          as the parameter and checks it against all custom input files.  It
          returns true/false when used in a <%if()%> context.

        * templates/vc10.mpd:

          Use the 'is_custom_input' function template to ensure that files
          listed as custom type inputs are not listed under template_files,
          header_files, inline_files, documentation_files, or resource_files.
          If a custom type input is also listed under source_files, we will
          leave it to the user to resolve this externally.

          This is technically only required for certain versions of vs2017 and
          vs2019, but in order to provide this functionality for just those
          two types would require a duplication of the vc10 template with a
          few minor adjustments.  Future fixes to the vc10 template would have
          needed to have been propagated to the slightly different vs2017
          template.  To simplify maintenance, I just made the changes to this
          template file.

        * docs/templates/iar.txt:
        * templates/iar.mpd:
        * templates/iar.mpt:

          Added a 'gruntimelibselect' template variable to change the DLib
          config setting.

Tue May 21 11:16:16 UTC 2019  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/iar.mpd:

Fri May 17 14:42:45 UTC 2019  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/IARProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/IARWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          If a project type requires relative paths, locate a relative path
          when replacing $() variables if at all possible.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * templates/iar.mpd:

          A new template function, 'extension', can be used to get the
          extension of a file.  Additionally, non-template files can now be
          obtained through the custom input file interface.

Thu May 16 18:04:40 UTC 2019  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/iar.mpd:

          Prepend $PROJ_DIR$ if the 'ilinkicffile' template variable is
          relative to the project directory.

        * modules/IARWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * templates/iar.mpd:

          Made it so the $WS_DIR$ and $PROJ_DIR$ variables are prepended
          only if the path is relative.

Wed May 15 18:25:52 UTC 2019  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/iar.mpd:

          Exclude template files from the build.

Fri May 10 16:09:37 UTC 2019  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/iar.mpd:

          Added support for passing compiler flags through the compile_flags
          template variable.

Mon May  6 16:35:07 UTC 2019  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/iar.mpt:

          Changed the configuration names as the previous names implied
          something that was not necessarily true.

Mon Apr 29 17:23:19 UTC 2019  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/iar.mpd:

          Added optimization options and custom build rules.

        * modules/DirectoryManager.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:
        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Replaced calls to Cwd::abs_path with an implementation in
          DirectoryManger that accounts for needs of Win32 specific
          paths.

        * templates/iar.mpd:
        * templates/iar.mpt:

          Fixes for linking executables and creating libraries.  Also
          added the use of lib_modifier.

Mon May 21 14:33:24 UTC 2018  Adam Mitz  <mitza@objectcomputing.com>

        * templates/vc10.mpd:

          Generate less XML for custom files with no build step.

        * templates/vs2017platforms.mpt:

          Updated default SDK version to match the current update of VS2017.

        * config/wireshark.mpb:
        * config/global.features:

          When using Wireshark builds built using Autoconf (like Linux),
          Wireshark 1.x on Windows, and systems where Wireshark headers are
          installed, use the wireshark feature as before.

          When using Wireshark builds built with CMake use wireshark_cmake
          set to the Wireshark source, $WIRESHARK_BUILD set to the build
          directory and $WIRESHARK_LIB set to relative path inside the build
          directory that contains the Wireshark dynamic libraries. These
          parameters replace wireshark2, $WIRESHARK2_BUILD, and
          $WIRESHARK2_BIN.

Mon Feb 13 21:58:22 UTC 2017  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Enhanced handling of 'gendir' for project types that use
          "combined custom" (mostly vc >= 10).  Need to track common
          'gendir' for output file and also get the input-file-specific
          value of 'gendir' to replace the <%gendir%> token.

Tue Feb  7 15:36:45 UTC 2017  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/uvis.mpd:

          Convert slashes in the project path to backslashes.

        * templates/uvis.mpd:

          Support building assembly files and only put the device and CMSIS
          sections in if the project is an executable and there are
          device_files.

Thu Nov 17 13:20:23 UTC 2016  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/uvis.mpd:

          Added the ability to set the IRAM1 and IRAM2 sizes.

          support building for specific targets.

Wed Nov 16 14:44:33 UTC 2016  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Depgen/Driver.pm:

          Windows.

        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Corrected linking with the Keil compiler.

          Fixed the implementation of the pure_libs keyword.

Thu Nov 10 18:00:05 UTC 2016  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/uvis.mpd:

          Updated to support 'postbuild' and to support linking in libraries
          to an executable.

Mon Oct 31 16:16:07 UTC 2016  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Updated to change the platform for the Keil compiler to something
          specific to the operating system and architecture.

Wed Oct 26 11:31:35 UTC 2016  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm (generated_source_listed):

          From Chad Elliott: removed an optimization that was invalid

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm (other changes):
        * modules/CommandHelper.pm:

          Allow CommandHelper::get_output to return more detailed
          dependency info.  See comments in that function for usage.

Mon Mar  7 19:40:37 UTC 2016  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed an issue with custom_only projects that define empty
          Source_Files sections.  For these projects, an empty section is
          equivalent to a defaulted section as they do not serve any real
          purpose.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          Fixed spacing.

Wed Feb 17 19:19:40 UTC 2016  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          When creating a project with only custom projects, keep explicitly
          added files when removing non-custom_only aspects of the project.

Tue Sep  8 13:16:45 UTC 2015  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added a C macro that corresponds to the coverage and profiling
          options.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where scoped names would get added to the non-scoped
          name in every scope.  This bug was introduced by me in my change
          from Fri Jul  6 16:46:47 UTC 2012.

Mon Feb 23 12:34:28 UTC 2015  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Do not completely override -value_template and -value_project
          settings given on the actual MPC command line with workspace
          'cmdline' settings.  They are now merged together.

Thu Nov 20 11:56:03 UTC 2014  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Made a tiny grammatical correction in an informational message.

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          When creating external dependencies, only create a full path using
          the output directory or current directory if the project name is
          not a full path itself.  Thank you to Manfred Peter <manfredpeter

          With TAO we have the case that exe and dll have the same
          name which causes problems with the pdb file. Add a new
          use_pdb_modifier which we enable by default for vc1x, it
          adds _dll to the pdb file for a dll, and _exe to the pdb
          file for a exe
