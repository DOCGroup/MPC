        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Corrected a bug reported by Johnny Willemsen where object files
          were not getting cleaned up if they contained a relative path with
          ".." in the name.  In the process, I cleaned up the template a bit
          which should allow this type to be generated slightly faster.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/DirectoryManager.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Made MPC more tolerant of file systems that are case insensitive.
          This will help with the relative path replacement on Windows and
          others that have this problematic type of file system.

Wed Jan  4 08:09:20 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where adding a grouped set of source files that are
          generated using a wildcard would cause a duplicate of the default
          group if files were added to a different after the generated
          group.

Tue Jan  3 08:26:34 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * USAGE:
        * modules/Options.pm:

          Added the possible language settings to the help message.

        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Allow control of the 'genflags' setting with the 'optimize'
          template variable.  This changes the default 'genflags' setting
          from -g to -O.

        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc7dll.mpt:
        * templates/vc7exe.mpt:

        * templates/vc8exe.mpt:
        * templates/vc8lib.mpt:
        * templates/vc8libexe.mpt:

          Introduced a new template variable, 'debug_prj', which helps
          control which run-time library is used during linking.
          Previously, this was controled by the 'optimize' template
          variable, but building a "Release" configuration with 'optimize'
          turned off did not work where inline functions were used in other
          libraries (being linked in) where 'optimize' was left on.

Mon Dec 26 21:02:36 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Set the run-time library to a static version if either template
          variables type_is_static or need_staticflags are set.

Thu Dec 22 13:56:14 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * modules/AutomakeProjectCreator.pm:

          Disable code that prefixed include paths with "$(srcdir)/".  In
          some cases an include path should be relative to the source dir,
          in others it should be relative to the build dir, and sometimes
          it should be relative to both.  Since it is impossible to guess
          which is the correct choice, require the *.mpc file to specify
          it correctly.

Thu Dec 22 15:17:30 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/vc7csharp.mpd:

          Added a missing <%endif%>.

Thu Dec 22 08:30:56 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * USAGE:

          Update the usage to contain the 'bds' type.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Fixed a feature where $() variables were automatically expanded
          during a subtraction.  Now, we only expand the $() variable if we
          could not find the subtraction value in the name value.

        * templates/bds.mpd:

          Modified the includes foreach to set the forcount base.

        * templates/bdsdll.mpt:
        * templates/bdsexe.mpt:

          Include the user_bds* file instead of the user_cbx* file.

Wed Dec 21 19:17:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          Set the TargetMachine when building for EM64T

        * templates/bdsdll.mpt:
        * templates/bdsexe.mpt:
        * modules/BDSProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/BDSWorkspaceCreator.pm:
          Initial version of Borland Developer Studio template. Work is
          being done for the C++ personality. All files, compiler flags
          and libs are generated but some more work has to be done to
          use these for a full build. Now they are already useful for
          debugging apps that are build from the command line.

        * modules/MPC.pm:
        * modules/MWC.pm:
          Added BDS files

Wed Dec 21 06:28:04 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * MPC.ico:
        * registry.pl:

          Added the ability to register the .mpc and .mwc file types as well
          as create context menus within the Windows explorer.

        * PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM:

          Fixed the URL for the MPC FAQ.

        * README:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added the ability to set the base for the <%forcount%> variable.
          See the README for details as to how to use this.  Also, added
          code to only check for mixed values (scalars and hash maps) if the
          foreach value is not the name of an MPC project keyword.

        * config/swig_java.mpb:

          Added support for using SWIG with Java.

        * modules/AutomakeProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/Driver.pm:
        * modules/GHSProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/HTMLProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/MakeProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed the convert_slashes() method.  And use the default from
          DirectoryManager.pm.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Use File::Spec to determine file system capabilities to give the
          right warning message.  Also added the ability to determine if any
          files were excluded when generating the default file list.

        * modules/DirectoryManager.pm:

          Corrected problems with using Cwd::getcwd() on VMS as it always
          leaves a trailing slash on the end which no other implementation
          does.  Also, switched the convert_slashes() method to return zero
          as the default (which will require slightly less code overall in
          MPC).

        * modules/HTMLWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * templates/html.mpd:

          Make the HTML acceptable by WC3 standards.

        * modules/MakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Added a .PHONY: target for each named target.  This will only work
          with GNU Make and won't hurt with other versions of make.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          1) Check for case insensitivity (from a new method) when checking
             whether we should use upper or lower case in the
             expand_variables() method.
          2) Added an is_keyword() method to allow the TemplateParser to
             determine if a variable is an MPC project keyword or not.
          3) When adding the built-in OS compatibility methods, check the
             base class to see if it's a WinProjectBase to determine if the
             project type will be used on Windows or not.

        * modules/WinProjectBase.pm:

          For Windows based project types, define the convert_slashes() and
          case_insensitive() methods.

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where file exclusions given on the command line
          wouldn't work because somewhere down the line MPC would change
          directory and nothing would match up.  Also, fixed a related bug
          where if all of the .mpc files normally contained within a
          workspace were excluded a default workspace would then be used
          possibly adding unwanted .mpc files.

        * mpc.pl:
        * mwc.pl:

          Finally corrected support for VMS.  FindBin doesn't work on VMS if
          you use a relative directory, so we just use rel2abs() on the
          dirname of $0 in this situation.

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/bmakedll.mpt:
        * templates/bmakedllexe.mpt:
        * templates/bmakelibexe.mpt:

          Modified these to move the binary compile flags into the template
          such that correct makefiles would be created if the user set the
          staticname to a valid name and set sharedname to empty.

        * templates/ghs.mpd:
        * templates/ghsdll.mpt:
        * templates/ghsdllexe.mpt:
        * templates/ghslib.mpt:

          Modified these to move the library extensions into the template
          such that correct build files would be created if the user set the
          staticname to a valid name and set sharedname to empty.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          Moved the output file to the last part of the link command line.
          Made "all" the default target for libraries.  Parameterized the
          pch extension.  Added better support for precompiled headers.

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Set the default pch extension to .gch.  Renamed the cxx
          configuration to cxx_tru64.  Added precompiled header support for
          SunCC (which was there as of SunCC 5.5).  For SunCC 5.4 and below,
          use -value_template pchsupport= to turn off precompiled header
          support.

        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc7dll.mpt:
        * templates/vc7exe.mpt:
        * templates/vc7lib.mpt:
        * templates/vc7libexe.mpt:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:
        * templates/vc8dll.mpt:
        * templates/vc8exe.mpt:
        * templates/vc8lib.mpt:
        * templates/vc8libexe.mpt:

          Modified the RuntimeLibrary setting to choose the right value for
          static/dynamic configurations.

Tue Dec  6 06:36:27 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where MPC would go into an infinite loop (while
          generating an intermediate workspace) if there were duplicate
          project names within a single workspace.  The sort_by_groups()
          method is being called prior to the method that checks for
          duplicate projects.

Mon Dec  5 14:17:35 2005  William Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * config/boost_unit_test_framework.mpb

        Automatic linking is not supported for the unit test
        framework, see http://boost.org/more/getting_started.html#auto-link.

Tue Nov 29 10:11:14 2005  William Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        Corrected a problem with my previous commit that broke boost
        on platforms other than gnuace and windows.  Thanks to Chad
        Elliott and Kitty B. for pointing out the problem and suggesting
        a fix.

Mon Nov 21 15:23:40 2005  William Otte  <wotte@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * config/boost_filesystem.mpb:
        * config/boost_regex.mpb:

        Scoped the lit_libs directive inside of a gnuace specific
        block to take advantage of automatic library resolution provided
        by the Windows version of boost.

Mon Nov 21 09:26:35 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * README:
        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Added a new clause (expand) that can be used to set the expansion
          values of a particular variable.  This lets users define to what
          $(VAR_NAME) gets expanded within an mpc file.  See the README for
          more information.

        * mpc.pl:
        * mwc.pl:

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * templates/make.mpd:
        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added better support for OpenVMS.  This mainly entailed dealing
          with the .dir extension on directories and [] within wildcard
          specifications (as the OpenVMS glob() function does not handle
          these).

Wed Nov 16 08:30:51 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where adding or subtracting a value with spaces would
          not work as expected.  When adding, the value would be split at
          each whitespace.  When subtracting, the value would never be
          removed.

          Setting a variable with spaces worked correctly.

Mon Nov 14 12:06:15 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/nmake.mpd:

          Corrected a problem in the realclean target where .dll, .lib and
          .exp files would not be deleted unless pdbc or pdbl template
          variables were defined.

Mon Nov 14 09:50:38 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where a project name that conflicts with a directory
          name would not get mapped in cases where the directory had
          multiple levels.

Mon Nov 14 07:40:19 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where sorting the projects (with a circular
          dependency) would run infinitely.  This was identical to the
          problem fixed on Thu Apr 15 13:16:03 2004 just in a different
          scenario.

Thu Nov 10 12:23:43 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          When checking for duplicate source files in duplicate_index(),
          always use lowercase (since this is currently only used on
          Windows).

        * templates/vc7vb.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Added a template variable, libname_prefix, that can be set to
          prefix all library names (sharedname, staticname and libs).  Note
          that lit_libs and pure_libs are not affected.

Mon Nov  7 10:15:31 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed a bug where a given custom input file does not match the
          custom defined input extensions and no source files are
          given, the generated source file name would still have the input
          file extension in the name (with an escaped period).

        * config/global.features:
        * config/xerces.mpb:

        Added a xerces feature to the xerces base project, similar to
        boost/zlib/zzip to allow disabling xerces specific projects.

Fri Oct 28 11:43:52 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * config/swig_perl.mpb:

          Added $(PERL5_INCLUDE) to the 'libpaths' as well as the 'includes'.

        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Corrected two instances of subdir_output which only show up if you
          set the template variable 'pdbc'.

Sun Oct 23 08:14:12 UTC 2005  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
          Generate also includes for the resource compiler

        * config/boost_thread.mpb:
        * config/boost_unit_test_framework.mpb:

          Added a $(BOOST_STATIC_LIB_PREFIX) to the library name for all
          boost libraries.  For some reason, they insist on prepend 'lib' to
          the name of all static libraries on Windows.  For
          unit_test_framework, prg_exec_monitor and test_exec_monitor, 'lib'
          is always prepended on Windows since these are currently always
          static.  Thanks to Kevin Heifner for pointing this out.

Thu Oct 13 17:24:21 2005  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm: Add the 3 magic bytes to the start
          of the .sln file that allow double-clicking on the .sln file's icon
          to auto-start Visual Studio.

Mon Oct 10 07:02:30 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where mixed case template variables within a foreach
          context were not being evaluated case insensitively.  This made it
          appear that these variables were not being set.

        * templates/vc8.mpd:

          Moved an endif to the correct location pertaining to precompiled
          headers.  Too much was being included within an if which depended
          upon the pch_header setting.

          Thanks to Thomas Rothfuss for reporting both of these bugs.

Fri Oct  7 13:50:49 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * modules/AutomakeWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Change the way RCS/CVS Id is emitted so it's the same as how it
          is expanded in souces checked out with -kk option.  This allows
          us to regenerate ACE and TAO's Makefile.am files and only see
          the "real" differences.

Fri Oct  7 09:33:41 2005  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@acorntoolworks.com>

        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Add support for custom file dependents.

Thu Oct  6 17:52:41 2005  Steve Huston  <shuston@riverace.com>

        * templates/vc8lib.mpt:
        * templates/vc8libexe.mpt:
        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt (new file):
          Added support for building Windows CE/Mobile from Visual Studio 2005.
          By default, only the regular desktop Win32 configurations will be
          generated, as before. The CE/mobile platform names can be specified
          using -value_templates platforms="....". The possible platform
          names are listed in vc8platforms.mpt.

          To avoid overwriting outputs when building multiple platforms in
          the same ACE_wrappers directory, a platform can supply an
          output_subdir setting (see vc8platforms.mpt). If specified, vc8.mpd
          will use this in the Intermediate/OutputDirectory entries.

          Corrected the directory changing code to take 2 or more deep
          relative paths into account.  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen
          <jwillemsen@remedy.nl> for reporting this.

        * templates/automake.mpd:

          Optimized this template with respect to checking a variable before
          using foreach.  The foreach already does this, so checking the
          variable before hand is a waste of time.

        * README:

        * templates/vc8libexe.mpt:

          It is invalid to enable incremental linking on release builds,
