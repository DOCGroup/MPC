Mon Feb 13 21:58:22 UTC 2017  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Enhanced handling of 'gendir' for project types that use
          "combined custom" (mostly vc >= 10).  Need to track common
          'gendir' for output file and also get the input-file-specific
          value of 'gendir' to replace the <%gendir%> token.

        * templates/uvis.mpd:

          Support building assembly files and only put the device and CMSIS
          sections in if the project is an executable and there are
          device_files.

Thu Nov 17 13:20:23 UTC 2016  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/uvis.mpd:

          Added the ability to set the IRAM1 and IRAM2 sizes.

        * templates/uvis.mpd:
        * templates/uvis.mpt:

          support building for specific targets.

Wed Nov 16 14:44:33 UTC 2016  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

          Windows.

          to an executable.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm (generated_source_listed):

          From Chad Elliott: removed an optimization that was invalid

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm (other changes):
        * modules/CommandHelper.pm:

          Allow CommandHelper::get_output to return more detailed
          dependency info.  See comments in that function for usage.

Mon Mar  7 19:40:37 UTC 2016  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed an issue with custom_only projects that define empty
          Source_Files sections.  For these projects, an empty section is
          equivalent to a defaulted section as they do not serve any real
          purpose.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          Fixed spacing.

Wed Feb 17 19:19:40 UTC 2016  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          When creating a project with only custom projects, keep explicitly
          added files when removing non-custom_only aspects of the project.

Tue Sep  8 13:16:45 UTC 2015  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * templates/makedll.mpt:

          Added a C macro that corresponds to the coverage and profiling
          options.

Mon Jul 27 20:04:02 UTC 2015  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where scoped names would get added to the non-scoped
          name in every scope.  This bug was introduced by me in my change
          from Fri Jul  6 16:46:47 UTC 2012.

Mon Feb 23 12:34:28 UTC 2015  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Do not completely override -value_template and -value_project
          settings given on the actual MPC command line with workspace
          'cmdline' settings.  They are now merged together.

        * All files:
          Removed subversion Id tag

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Completed the changes for the entry below.  The original
          modification was not complete.

Thu Nov 20 11:56:03 UTC 2014  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Made a tiny grammatical correction in an informational message.

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          When creating external dependencies, only create a full path using
          the output directory or current directory if the project name is
          not a full path itself.  Thank you to Manfred Peter <manfredpeter
          at siemens dot com> for finding and reporting this bug.

        * templates/vc1xdll.mpt:
        * templates/vc1xexe.mpt:
          Set same pdbc/pdbl settings to generate pdb files as we do
          with older vc versions

        * templates/vc1xexe.mpt:
        * templates/vc7dll.mpt:
          With TAO we have the case that exe and dll have the same
          name which causes problems with the pdb file. Add a new
          use_pdb_modifier which we enable by default for vc1x, it
          adds _dll to the pdb file for a dll, and _exe to the pdb
          file for a exe
