        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          Use release_link_options for the SuperSonic SDK

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          No need to set charset anymore

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added a new template function, 'extensions', that can be used to
          get a list of valid extensions based on the component name (e.g,
          source_files, header_files, inline_files, etc.)

        * templates/em3.mpd:
        * templates/vc6.mpd:
        * templates/vc7.mpd:
        * templates/vc8.mpd:
        * templates/wb26wrproject.mpd:

          Use the 'extensions' function instead of hard-coded strings.

        * modules/Creator.pm:

          Default the language to 'cplusplus' if it isn't provided during
          construction.  This ensures that language is always set and we
          don't have to check it to make sure it's defined elsewhere.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Modified the behavior of dealing with resource files.  The
          behavior specific to C++ was being applied to all languages.

        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Added implementations of various template functions.  Some were
          required for the bmake template change below.

        * modules/WixProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed unused code.

        * modules/WixWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Fixed a the case of the WixProjectCreator name.

        * templates/bmake.mpd:
        * templates/bmakedll.mpt:
        * templates/bmakedllexe.mpt:

          Added the ability to build static projects without providing the
          -static option to MPC.  The static-only projects can still be
          created with the -static option, but it is no longer necessary.

Tue Aug  4 10:31:40 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * config/unicode.mpb:
          Changed this to a feature

Mon Aug  3 16:43:18 UTC 2009  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/Driver.pm:
        * mpc.pl:
        * mwc.pl:

          Added a pair of constants that will be used in determining which
          type of creators to use (either workspace or project).

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Removed the use of a hard-coded string and simplified some code.

        * config/nddslib.mpb:
          Added requires += ndds. If you want to use RTI DDS you have to
          add ndds=1 to your default.features file. This way we can add
          dds4ccm support to CIAO without requiring all users to install
          RTI DDS

        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Added support for setting the install location of a set of
          files for a project using 'install_location'. This takes a
          comma separated list of directories that represent the location
          for installing the files. The following is a simple example:

            specific (wix) {
              install_location = etc models
            }

          The example above will install files for the given project
          in etc/models directory under the root install directory.

        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Fixed bugs GME section of generated Wix files for vc8.

Sun Jun 28 08:05:20 UTC 2009  James H. Hill  <hillj@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Added support for installing GME components using Wix. In order
          to include GME components in the installer, you must define the
          following properties in a *wix* scope:

            gme_install     = [0 | 1]; default is 0
            gme_register    = [HKLM | HKCU]; default is HKLM
            gme_progid      = <program id>
            gme_uuid        = <uuid>
            gme_paradigms   = <space separated list>
            gme_has_icon    = [0 | 1]
            gme_description = <descrption of component>
            gme_tooltip     = <tooltip for component>

          The values for each of these properties can be found in
          ComponentConfig.h

        * modules/WixProjectCreator.pm:
        * templates/wix.mpd:

          Added support to creating a directory if there is no output
          file specified in the project.

          Disabled skipping projects if there are no useful targets
          defined.

          Added markers to the top and bottom of the component. The
          name of the markers are: component_top and component_bottom.

        * modules/WixProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WixWorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Forgot to change the case on the pacakge names.

Wed Jun 24 21:19:36 UTC 2009  James H. Hill  <hillj@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * config/wix.mpb:
        * config/wix_ui.mpb:
        * config/wix_xml.mpb:

          Base projects for building Wix files.

Wed Jun 24 21:14:20 UTC 2009  James H. Hill  <hillj@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * modules/WixProjectCreator.pm:
        * modules/WixWorkspaceCreator.pm:
        * templates/wix.mpd:
        * templates/wix.mpt:

          . First version of the Wix module that is used in conjuction
            with the Wix toolset that creates .msi files. This project
            type will generate the include files (.wxi) that can be included
            in a .wxs configuration file.

            Right now, the installer only can generate files for
            shared libraries. The next update will include support for
            executables.

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          Explicitly set charset to get CharacterSet set when using
          multiple platforms

Tue May 26 19:01:53 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Changed hard-coded 'resource_files' to a call to get_resource_tag,
          which is a new method on ProjectCreator.  get_resource_tag
          determines the name of 'resource_files' for the current language
          based on the %language hash (for C# and VB this is 'resx_files').

Mon May 25 11:03:31 UTC 2009  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * templates/vc8platforms.mpt:
          Added a new target and corrected some wince versions
