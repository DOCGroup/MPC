Mon Sep 26 21:08:34 UTC 2016  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm (generated_source_listed):

          From Chad Elliott: removed an optimization that was invalid

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm (other changes):
        * modules/CommandHelper.pm:

Mon Mar  7 19:40:37 UTC 2016  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Fixed an issue with custom_only projects that define empty
          Source_Files sections.  For these projects, an empty section is
          equivalent to a defaulted section as they do not serve any real
          purpose.

        * templates/make.mpd:

          Fixed spacing.

Wed Feb 17 19:19:40 UTC 2016  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

          When creating a project with only custom projects, keep explicitly
          added files when removing non-custom_only aspects of the project.

          Added a C macro that corresponds to the coverage and profiling
          options.

        * modules/Creator.pm:
        * modules/TemplateParser.pm:

          Fixed a bug where scoped names would get added to the non-scoped
          name in every scope.  This bug was introduced by me in my change
          from Fri Jul  6 16:46:47 UTC 2012.

Mon Feb 23 12:34:28 UTC 2015  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * modules/WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          Do not completely override -value_template and -value_project
          settings given on the actual MPC command line with workspace
          'cmdline' settings.  They are now merged together.

        * All files:
          Removed subversion Id tag

          modification was not complete.

        * modules/ProjectCreator.pm:

          Made a tiny grammatical correction in an informational message.

        * modules/VC8WorkspaceCreator.pm:

          When creating external dependencies, only create a full path using
          the output directory or current directory if the project name is
          not a full path itself.  Thank you to Manfred Peter <manfredpeter
          at siemens dot com> for finding and reporting this bug.

        * templates/vc1xdll.mpt:
        * templates/vc1xexe.mpt:
          Set same pdbc/pdbl settings to generate pdb files as we do
          with older vc versions

Wed Nov  5 08:03:49 UTC 2014  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * docs/templates/vc10.txt:
        * templates/vc10.mpd:
        * templates/vc1xdll.mpt:
        * templates/vc1xexe.mpt:
        * templates/vc7dll.mpt:
          With TAO we have the case that exe and dll have the same
          name which causes problems with the pdb file. Add a new
          use_pdb_modifier which we enable by default for vc1x, it
          adds _dll to the pdb file for a dll, and _exe to the pdb
          file for a exe
